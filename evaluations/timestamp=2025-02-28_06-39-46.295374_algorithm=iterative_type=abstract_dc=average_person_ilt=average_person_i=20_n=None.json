      "prediction": "Abstract   Novel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles. This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.",

Using this technique, we calculated the maximum transcription rate for each keyboard. The results show that transcription rates were higher for the QWERTY keyboard than for the T9, despite the T9 keyboard\u2019s apparent superior physical characteristics. An ancillary experiment demonstrated that the poorer performance of the T9 layout may have resulted from an increase in visual scanning time due to perceptual grouping of the letters on the keys.

Moreover, when changing the access style between interactive and passive, the presentation should be adjusted for the terminal type because the lacking information is usually not perceived after transformation. To adjust the play style of Web content to the terminal type, we developed a method for visual presentation. First, using keyword analysis, we represent the emotional aspect of a Web page by adjusting the background color of the screen. Second, we emphasize the subject of the content by the logotype of the keyword. Third, we segment the picture of the content into pieces and present one after another using visual effects.

The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.",

One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles using sensor-based perception and inter-vehicle communications. When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same spatial area simultaneously, they might collide with one another, might become deadlocked, or might slam on the brakes making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers in a self-driving vehicle. In this paper, we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points, where two lanes with different priorities meet. We present a safe protocol for merge points named Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points, where self-driving vehicles use both vehicular communications and their own perception systems for cooperating with other self-driving and/or human-driven vehicles. Our simulation results show that our traffic protocol has higher traffic throughput, compared to simple traffic protocols, while ensuring safety.",

On the other hand, the popular approach in the automotive industry is the utilization of MATLAB/Simulink which is software for modeling, simulating, and analyzing. MATLAB/Simulink provides an interface between ROS and MATLAB/Simulink that enables to create functionalities of ROS-based robots in MATLAB/Simulink. However, it is not been fully utilized in the development of self-driving systems yet because there are not enough samples for self-driving, and it is difficult for developers to adopt co-development. Therefore, we provide a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for a ROS-based self-driving system called Autoware. Autoware is popular open-source software that provides a complete set of self-driving modules. The provided benchmark contains MATLAB/Simulink samples available in Autoware. They help to design ROS-based self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink.",

One cannot hope to sufficiently cover the huge number of possible driving situations self-driving cars must be tested for by manually creating such tests.

      "prediction": "The importance of research on misinformation has received wide recognition. Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of theoretical models and the scarcity of misinformation in support of such research. This paper aims to address the challenges of misinformation by defining and making it easier to share and use. In particular, a representation and a model of misinformation are proposed through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating existing work in the field. The ontology-supported misinformation model can not only guide future misinformation research but also lay the foundation for building a digital misinformation library by advancing our knowledge on misinformation and by improving its sharing, management, and reuse. In addition, we present a formal methodology for managing misinformation in a digital library, and suggest future research directions related to the misinformation model.",

Smartphones are packed with functionality that can easily be used for data theft or inappropriate contact with other parties - none of which passes through company-owned systems, and is to all intents and purposes 'off the grid'. Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued, along with ensuring that processes are in place when suspicions are raised, explains Philip Ridley of CCL-Forensics. Detecting corporate fraudsters is a constant challenge. It's about staying one step ahead of those who misuse technology to commit fraud. What's more, the methods through which technology can be used to commit fraud are constantly evolving. This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or just good old-fashioned theft.",

It gives the information about the processing history of an image, and also can expose forgeries present in an image. There have been a few methods proposed to detect different types of image editing operations in a single framework. However, all the operations have to be known a priori in the training phase. But, in real-forensics scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based method which can differentiate between different types of image editing operations. The proposed method classifies image patches in a pair-wise fashion as either similarly or differently processed using a deep siamese neural network. Once the network learns feature that can discriminate between different image editing operations, it can differentiate between different image editing operations not present in the training stage.

The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec. We present the same results in this research and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods of vision and learning based navigation. With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too. Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest. In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot. Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames. Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning. The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience. Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process. With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.",

Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for maximization of both muscle size and strength. However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size affects a change in strength is surprisingly based on little evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.",

The purpose of this narrative review is to present and discuss a meta-analysis with regression that evaluated experimental research on meal frequency with respect to changes in fat mass and lean mass. Feeding frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and body fat percentage as well as an increase in fat-free mass. However, sensitivity analysis of the data showed that the positive findings were the product of a single study, casting doubt as to whether more frequent meals confer beneficial effects on body composition. In conclusion, although the initial results of this meta-analysis suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be interpreted with circumspection.",

Several observational studies lend support to this hypothesis, with an inverse relationship noted between the frequency of eating and adiposity. The purpose of this narrative review is to present and discuss a meta-analysis with regression that evaluated experimental research on meal frequency with respect to changes in fat mass and lean mass. Feeding frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and body fat percentage as well as an increase in fat-free mass. However, sensitivity analysis revealed that the positive results were largely due to one study, raising questions about the effectiveness of more frequent meals for improving body composition. In conclusion, although the initial results of this meta-analysis suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be interpreted with circumspection.",

An often overlooked variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration. Duration amounts to the sum total of the concentric, eccentric, and isometric components of a repetition, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT. Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s. From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",

Resistance exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise, but resistance exercise is contraindicated in patients with hypertension who have chest symptoms such as chest pain.",

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6\u201315 RM loading range (15\u201340 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects.

      "prediction": "The quest to increase lean body mass is widely pursued by those who lift weights. Research is lacking, however, as to the best approach for maximizing exercise-induced muscle growth. Bodybuilders generally train with moderate loads and fairly short rest intervals that induce high amounts of metabolic stress. Powerlifters, on the other hand, routinely train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods between sets. It's unclear which training method is best for building muscle. Multiple factors, such as mechanical tension and muscle damage, contribute to muscle growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to extensively review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and (b) to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal protocol for maximizing muscle growth.",
