This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice.",

Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it might improve the health of individuals and communities, and, if successful, might be seen as a public good. However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. Remarkably, the necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been discussed by its proponents. The present discourse on moral obligations of future generations, although not referring to women, seems to imply that women might be required, morally, if not legally, to reproduce with IVF. Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed. These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men. Despite the lack of a unified feminist conclusion in the discussions about the merits and risks of human genome modification, there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.",

Web pages are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV. Manual reconstruction of web pages for these devices would ease the problem; however, the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have to customize a web page for each possible display device. In this paper, we propose a document segmentation and presentation system. The system automatically divides a web document into a number of logical segments based on the screen size and the structure and content of the document. Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation. The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding.",

These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems. These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars.
