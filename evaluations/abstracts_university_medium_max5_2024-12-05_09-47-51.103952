Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.",

Though they reach state-of-the-art performance on a particular data-set, but fall short of tackling multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel and one-for-all architecture that aces multiple benchmarks with better overall score than the state-of-the-art architectures. Our model is made of residual convolutional blocks with hierarchical dilated skip connections joined in steps. With this we score 99.33% Accuracy in German sign recognition benchmark and 99.17% Accuracy in Belgian traffic sign classification benchmark.

This model examines how trust in self-driving vehicles and interest in technology affect people's choices. \n\nThe results show that public transport passengers currently prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus, but only for short trips. This preference is due to the finding that the value of travel time is about twice as high for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus during short commuting trips. Furthermore, findings suggest that the popularity of self-driving buses decreases when a human steward is on board or when they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes. \n\nAdditionally, people who show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology view the self-driving buses more positively than others. Preferences for automated public transport services are expected to evolve as the transition progresses from demonstration pilots to regular operations.",

We evaluate the NCI using financial documents from large web news sources daily, from October 2011 to July 2013, and analyze how financial markets interact with related news. We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the financial markets. Cohesiveness is a more general and robust measure of systemic risk expressed in news than measures based on simply counting specific terms.

Depending on the environment and the paths, following the human might not be the optimal solution because better paths for the robot exist. We propose to predict the humanâs future movements and use this information to generate navigation actions for the robot. The estimation of the humanâs position and the prediction of the next destination are uncertain because of the occlusions due to obstacles and the robotâs limited field of view. Our approach deals with considering occlusions so the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view.

It is plausible that cycle training requires a longer period to significantly increase muscle size compared to typical resistance training due to a much slower hypertrophy rate. Cycle training induces muscle hypertrophy similarly between young and older age groups, while strength gain seems to favor older adults, which suggests that the probability for improving in muscle quality appears to be higher in older adults compared to young adults.

Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycle training on muscle size and strength of the lower extremity and the possible mechanisms for increasing muscle size with cycle training. Cycle training may take longer to noticeably increase muscle size than regular weight training because it leads to muscle growth at a slower rate.

This means older adults may have a better chance of improving muscle quality than younger adults. For young adults, higher-intensity intermittent cycling may be needed to achieve strength gains.

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6â15 RM loading range (15â40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects.

It addresses issues with small styluses and keyboards found in current PDAs. Unlike a cellphone, MiPad allows users to use both speech and touch. It has a microphone that turns on when a user selects a field. As the user taps the screen or scrolls, these actions help narrow down the possible spoken commands. MiPad operates on a Windows CE Pocket PC with a connected Windows 2000 machine that handles speech recognition.

The paper discusses MiPad's design and implementation, which are still in progress, as well as a preliminary user study comparing it to existing pen-based PDA interfaces. MiPad is a prototype application that shows how wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) can benefit from integrating continuous speech recognition (CSR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) technologies. This allows users to perform common tasks using a multimodal interface and wireless technology. It aims to solve the issue of having to use small styluses or type on tiny keyboards on modern PDAs. MiPad does not rely solely on speech interaction, unlike a cellular phone. MiPad has a built-in microphone that turns on when a field is selected. When a user taps the screen or utilizes a built-in roller for navigation, this action reduces the range of potential instructions for spoken word comprehension. MiPad is currently operating on a Windows CE Pocket PC, with speech recognition being carried out on a Windows 2000 machine.

Our research shows we can predict entertainment content needed in the car with over 98% accuracy and can reduce delays. However, getting these contents from the Data Center can slow down service because of the long time it takes to communicate between the car and the Data Center. To solve this, we suggest using deep learning methods in a system called Multi-access Edge Computing. First, we use a technique called Multi-Layer Perceptron to predict what contents people will want in certain areas, which helps to save time in getting content to the car. Next, we use Convolutional Neural Networks to determine the age and gender of passengers, which helps in selecting appropriate entertainment content. Finally, we frame our caching strategy as a math problem aimed at reducing download delays. We apply a method called Block Successive Majorization-Minimization to find the best solution.",

Prediction accuracy was 98.04% for contents to be cached for self-driving cars. Such an approach can minimize delay.

It is deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) structure that moves services from a centralized cloud to the network edges and closer to the customer. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a type of artificial neural network, is used to predict the content requested in specific areas. To reduce delay, MLP outputs are sent to MEC servers for roadside units. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict passengersâ age and gender to cache adapted entertainment content.

We introduce a stylized social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on the arrival of new information, while a fraction of participants display confirmation bias, enabling them to reject news that are incongruent with their pre-existing beliefs. We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation. Furthermore, the model results in states where unbiased agents behave \"as if\" they were biased, due to their biased neighbours effectively functioning as gatekeepers, restricting their access to free and diverse information. We derive analytic results for the distribution of individual agentsâ beliefs, explicitly demonstrating the aforementioned trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity, which we further validate against US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming.

A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we systematically explore this phenomenon. For this, we propose a 3-phase analysis approach, which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in the Alexa 1 million websites.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based method which can differentiate between different types of image editing operations.

According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth.

Resistance training is also effective in reducing lower back pain and relieving discomfort from arthritis and fibromyalgia, and it can help reverse some aging effects in muscles.",
        "reference": "Per decade, inactive adults experience a muscle loss of 3% to 8%, a reduction of resting metabolic rate (energy consumed by the body at rest) and fat accumulation. Ten weeks of strength training may increase fat-free mass by 1.4 kg, resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg. Benefits of strength training include improved physical performance, movement control, walking speed, functional independence, cognitive abilities, and self-esteem. Strength training may assist prevention and management of type 2 diabetes by decreasing abdominal fat, reducing HbA1c which is a form of hemoglobin linked to a sugar, increasing the density of glucose transporter type 4, and improving insulin sensitivity. Strength training may enhance cardiovascular health, by reducing resting blood pressure, decreasing 'bad' cholesterol and triglycerides (main constituents of body fat), and increasing 'good' cholesterol. Strength training may promote bone development, with studies showing 1% to 3% increase in bone mineral density. Strength training may be effective for reducing low back pain, joint and muscle pain, and reverse specific aging factors in muscles.",

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6â15 RM loading range (15â40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects. Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.",

Aim for at least 4 sets per muscle group, using weights that allow for 6 to 15 repetitions. Advanced techniques like supersets and drop sets can cut training time in half while keeping the same volume, but they may be better for muscle growth than building strength, so more studies are needed. Lastly, keep warm-ups specific to the exercises and only stretch if you want to improve flexibility.",
        "reference": "Lack of time is one of the most common reason for not exercising. The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be time-efficient by evaluating research on training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. We recommend choosing bilateral (with the two arms or legs), multi-joint (multiple joints involved) exercises that include full dynamic movements and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights. Weekly training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.) is more important than training frequency and we recommend a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a load that permits to do 6 to 15 repetitions. Advanced training techniques like combining exercises with no rest or shortening the rest time while using lighter weights can cuts the training time in half, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better to increase muscle mass than strength. Finally, we advise exercise-specific warm-ups, and stretching only if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.",

Meta-regression analysis of non-volume-equated studies showed a significant effect favoring higher frequencies, although the overall difference in magnitude of effect between frequencies of 1 and 3+ days per week was modest. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not significantly or meaningfully impact muscle hypertrophy when volume is equated.

This paper reviewed various studies to see how often people should train each week for muscle growth.

When looking at studies that didn't match workout volume, training more often seemed to help a little more, but the difference between training once a week and three or more times was small. In summary, evidence suggests that how often you train doesn't significantly affect muscle growth if the total volume is the same.

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in a university-based resident clinic. Residents in internal medicine were given a CDSS suite based on PDA. Intervention residents were provided with a CDSS that had a prediction rule for assessing gastrointestinal risk related to NSAIDs and recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as standardized patients (SPs), who were equipped with musculoskeletal symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the study without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety outcomes of prescriptions given to standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A committee of clinicians who didn't know about the participant, intervention group assignment, or the baseline or follow-up data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was safe or unsafe. The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The main outcome measured the difference in unsafe prescribing between the intervention and control groups. At the beginning of the study, both groups had a similar proportion of unsafe prescriptions. (0.27 vs 0.29) After controlling for the baseline performance, it was found that those who received the CDSS suite prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more safely than those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to the CDSS through a PDA documented a more comprehensive assessment of gastrointestinal risk in patients. Moreover, the presence of the CDSS resulted in fewer unsafe treatment decisions compared to participants who did not have access to the CDSS.",

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and initial evaluation of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based decision support system (DSS) for pediatric depression screening in ages 8 to 18 years of age by pediatric advanced practice nurse (APN) students. Three aspects are described: selection of depression screening instrument; integration of the instrument into the PDA; and quantitative (usage) and qualitative (focus group) evaluation. Only one third of eligible patients were screened. Twenty percent of those screened were identified as at risk for mood disorder. The barriers to screening identified through focus groups included a lack of time, knowledge, intervention protocol, referral resources, PDA usability issues, preceptor motivation and comfort, as well as perceived or real cultural barriers. Suggestions for educational, research, and interventions to integrate clinical based PDA-based screening are discussed.",

This paper aims to explain the creation and initial assessment of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based decision support system (DSS) designed for screening depression in children ages 8 to 18, specifically by pediatric advanced practice nurse (APN) students. The paper discusses three main areas: choosing the right tool to screen for depression, incorporating that tool into the PDA, and evaluating the system both quantitatively (by examining usage data) and qualitatively (through focus group discussions). Only one-third of eligible patients were screened for depression. Of those screened, 20% were found to be at risk for mood disorders. The focus groups revealed several barriers to screening, including lack of time, insufficient knowledge, unclear intervention guidelines, lack of referral resources, issues with the PDA's usability, varying levels of motivation and comfort among teachers, and perceived or actual cultural barriers. The paper also suggests ways to improve education, research, and interventions for using PDA-based screening in clinical settings.",

It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios. The state of the art in driving scenario generation, as adopted by some of the front-runners of the self-driving car industry, still relies on human input [1].

Simultaneously, they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to self-select the narratives they want to be exposed to, both through active (confirmation bias) and passive (personalized news algorithms) self-reinforcing mechanisms. A precise theoretical understanding of such trade-offs is still largely missing. We introduce a stylized social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on the arrival of new information, while a fraction of participants display confirmation bias, enabling them to reject news that are incongruent with their pre-existing beliefs. We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation. Furthermore, the model results in states where unbiased agents behave \"as if\" they were biased, due to their biased neighbours effectively functioning as gatekeepers, restricting their access to free and diverse information. We derive analytic results for the distribution of individual agentsâ beliefs, explicitly demonstrating the aforementioned trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity, which we further validate against US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming. Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by preserving information diversity in a social network.

Due to guidelines set by governments regarding how high civil drones can operate, there is growing interest in navigation that focuses on tracking roads. To achieve the aforementioned tasks, we propose a solution based on imitation learning, which means teaching the drone to navigate by mimicking an expert pilot. Our classifier is designed using a fast 39-layered Inception model, which is a type of deep learning model used for image classification, that evaluates the presence of roads based on detailed images taken from various angles. Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of how much processing power it requires and its accuracy compared to many existing models for imitation learning. The data used to train the system was collected by flying the drone in urban and semi-urban areas, captured by experts who have at least 6 to 8 years of flying experience. Permissions were obtained from the relevant authorities to ensure that minimal risk to pedestrians was involved in the data collection process. With the extensive amount of data collected from drones, we have successfully navigated through roads without crashing or overshooting, achieving an accuracy rate of 98.44%.",

The solution is compared with other recent methods. Drones are increasingly used in the civilian and commercial domain and need to be autonomous. Governments set guidelines on the operation ceiling of civil drones. So, road-tracking based navigation is attracting interest. Researchers propose data-driven solutions allowing drones to autonomously navigate city streets, learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot. The algorithm, based on the Inception model, detects roads using tomographic reconstructions. The Inception model is an extension of classic image classification algorithms. The Inception-v3 architecture has better accuracy than many existing models of imitation learning. The data used for training the system was captured from the drone over urban streets, navigated by an expert pilot. Data collection requires special permission to ensure pedestrian security.

It will also highlight how these changes vary after resistance training, which involves heavy lifting, and aerobic exercise, which is endurance-based like running.

During such periods, the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain (rather than improve) physical performance. Similarly, certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods, namely athletes (during the competitive season and off-season) and military personnel (during deployment). In general populations, endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33â66% (as low as 13â26 minutes per session), as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained. Strength and muscle size (at least in younger populations) can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with as little as 1 session of strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity (relative load) is maintained; whereas, in older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 sessions per week and 2â3 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity.

        "prediction": "Nearly every person who exercises regularly faces times when they have less time to work out due to personal, family, or business reasons. During these times, the goal of physical training may shift to maintaining performance instead of improving it. This is especially true for certain groups like athletes, who want to keep up their performance during both competition season and off-season, and military personnel during their time in service. Research shows that most people can keep their endurance performance for up to 15 weeks with just 2 training sessions each week or by reducing their exercise volume by 33-66%. This means exercising for as little as 13-26 minutes each session, as long as the intensity, which refers to the level of effort measured by heart rate, is kept high. For maintaining strength and muscle size, younger individuals can do this with only 1 session of strength training each week and 1 set for each exercise, provided they also keep the intensity high. In contrast, older individuals may need to work out 2 times a week and do 2-3 sets per exercise while still maintaining intensity. The key takeaway is that exercise intensity is essential for sustaining physical performance over time, even with significant cuts to how often and how much one exercises.",

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6â15 RM loading range (15â40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects. Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.",

This review aims to find the best ways to do strength training efficiently by examining research on important training factors, advanced training methods, and the importance of warming up and stretching. To make strength training more time-efficient, we suggest focusing on exercises that work on both sides of the body at the same time and involve multiple joints, which means they require the use of larger muscle groups. This includes performing at least one leg exercise (like squats), one exercise for pulling movements of the upper body (like pull-ups), and one exercise for pushing movements of the upper body (like bench press). You can use machines or free weights depending on your training goals, what's available, and what you prefer. The total volume of training in a week is more important than how often you train, and we recommend doing at least four sets for each muscle group each week, using a load that allows for 6 to 15 repetitions. You may do 15 to 40 repetitions if you push yourself to your limits. Advanced training techniques, such as supersets (doing two exercises back-to-back without rest), drop sets (reducing weight after reaching fatigue), and rest-pause training (taking short breaks during sets), can cut training time in half compared to traditional methods while keeping the training volume the same. However, these techniques are likely more effective at increasing muscle size than building muscle strength, and further research is needed to understand long-term effects of these methods. Lastly, we recommend limiting the warm-up to exercises specific to the workout and only focusing on stretching if your training goal is to improve flexibility.",

Mobile devices and personal computers have similar Web interfaces, although they may look different depending on the device. Mobile and desktop terminals have some differences in device characteristics, such as screen resolution and sound quality, which can affect how content is presented on the device. When switching between interactive and passive access styles, the presentation needs to be adjusted for the device type because some information may be lost during transformation and not noticed by the user. We developed a visual presentation method to customize how Web content is displayed based on the device type. First, we analyze keywords to capture the emotional tone of a web page and adjust the screen's background color accordingly. Then, we use the keyword's logo to highlight the main subject of the content. Finally, we divide the content's image into sections and present them one by one using visual effects. These steps can be used on any type of device.",

The results illustrate how biases in combination with each other and in different organizational contexts affect organizational performance. We find that, contrary to intuition, some combinations of biases significantly improve organizational performance while these biases negatively affect organizational performance when they occur separately. This might evoke considerations whether decision-making should be as rational as possible.",
        "prediction": "Research shows that people face many biases when making decisions. In our study, we look at how these biases affect managers when they make decisions together and how this impacts the organization. Our simulations show that when managers decide based on the complexity of their organization and the rewards they get, they still experience biases. The results show that some biases can work together to improve performance, even though they can harm performance on their own. This raises questions about whether decision-making should aim to be as rational as possible.",

The results illustrate how combined biases in different contexts affect organizational performance. Contrary to expectations, some combinations of biases improve organizational performance.

In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in OSNs, and we focus in particular on the Twitter social network. Based on user and tweets characteristics, we build a misinformation detection model that identifies suspicious behavioral patterns and exploits supervised learning techniques to detect misinformation. Our extensive experimental results on 80294 unique tweets and 59660 users illustrate that our approach effectively identifies misinformation during emergencies. Furthermore, our model manages to timely identify misinformation, a feature that can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation.",

Misinformation is false or incorrect information that can be shared on purpose or by mistake. In this study, we look at how to identify misinformation on OSNs, especially on Twitter. We create a model to detect misinformation based on user and tweet features. This model looks for strange behavior patterns and uses supervised learning to find misinformation.

A precise theoretical understanding of such trade-offs is still largely missing. We introduce a stylized social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on the arrival of new information, while a fraction of participants display confirmation bias, enabling them to reject news that are incongruent with their pre-existing beliefs. We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation. Furthermore, the model results in states where unbiased agents behave \"as if\" they were biased, due to their biased neighbours effectively functioning as gatekeepers, restricting their access to free and diverse information. We derive analytic results for the distribution of individual agentsâ beliefs, explicitly demonstrating the aforementioned trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity, which we further validate against US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming.

Aiming to detect such forgery manipulations under the same quantization matrix, we propose a detection method by using shift-recompression -based reshuffle characteristic features. The learning classifiers are applied for classification. Our experimental results indicate that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and relevant manipulations with the same quantization matrix.",

We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.",

Because of this belief, many training programs focus on growing muscle size and strength together. However, there is not much evidence to support that muscle size and strength changes are linked. We think these changes might be different based on: (1) the weak link between muscle size change and muscle strength change after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass when stopping training but still keeping muscle strength; and (3) similar muscle growth from both low-weight and high-weight training but different strength results.",

A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent.

These myonuclei are protected from the high cell death that can happen in shrinking muscles. Fibers with more myonuclei grow faster with heavy exercise. So, these nuclei act as a type of memory for strength. This memory may last a long time in humans. Myonuclei can stay stable for at least 15 years and maybe even longer.

An often overlooked variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration. Duration amounts to the sum total of the concentric, eccentric, and isometric components of a repetition, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT. Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s. From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",

These factors include choosing exercises, the order they are done, rest time, how much weight to lift, and total training volume. One important factor that is often missed is the duration of each repetition. This refers to how long each part of the movement takes and depends on the speed of the rep. We did a thorough review and analysis to see if changing the duration of reps can improve muscle growth. Our results show that muscle growth is similar with rep durations from 0.5 to 8 seconds. This means you can use a variety of rep durations to grow muscles. However, training with very slow repetitions lasting more than 10 seconds is less effective for muscle growth. There is not enough controlled research on this topic to make strong conclusions.",
        "reference": "Maximizing the muscle growth following strength training can be done by manipulating variables like exercise selection, exercise order, rest intervals, intensity of maximal load, and training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.). A neglected variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration. Total duration of a repetition is the sum of the contraction, the lengthening and isometric (static contraction) and is based on the tempo. We conducted a review and analysis of multiple studies to determine if modification of repetition duration can amplify the muscle growth. Results indicate that muscle growth is similar when training with repetition durations from 0.5 to 8 s. Using a wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is less efficient for muscle growth, although a lack of studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",

Bodybuilders generally train with moderate loads and fairly short rest intervals that induce high amounts of metabolic stress. Powerlifters, on the other hand, routinely train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods between sets. Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for hypertrophic gains. It has been shown that many factors mediate the hypertrophic process and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in exercise-induced muscle growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to extensively review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and (b) to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal protocol for maximizing muscle growth.",
        "prediction": "Many people who lift weights want to increase lean body mass. But there isnât much research on the best way to build muscle. Bodybuilders usually train with moderate weights and short breaks. This creates a lot of metabolic stress. Powerlifters train with heavy weights and take long breaks. Both types of lifters have strong muscles, but it is unclear which training method builds more muscle. Many factors affect muscle growth. Mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all play a role. This paper has two main goals: to review the research on how muscles grow and to find the best training method for muscle growth.",
