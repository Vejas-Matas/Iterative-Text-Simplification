This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.",

As we increasingly interact with these artificial agents in unsupervised settings, with no human mediators, their seeming autonomy and increasingly sophisticated functionality and behavior raise legal and philosophical questions. Focusing too much on the machines distracts us from the important debates about data-driven ethical dilemmas, such as privacy, fairness, and discrimination. While machines may exacerbate or highlight these ethical challenges, it is ultimately humans who must be held accountable. Policymakers should work to create shared guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling. Such guidelines would cover the use of legal and technical methods to protect data, criteria for identifying unethical or illegal behavior, categories of privacy and non-privacy harms, and strategies to empower individuals by giving them access to data in a clear format.",

But this only used robots made by Universal Robots (UR). Here we work with a new robot arm - Kuka LBR iiwa which looks very different and has an additional joint. We collect a number of smaller datasets and use transfer learning techniques on the CNN trained on UR robots to adapt it to a robot that looks different. Transfer learning requires smaller training datasets, learns faster and reaches similar or even better accuracy."

The results show that currently public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus only for short trips. This is due to the finding that the value of travel time is about twice as high for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus for a short commuting trip. Findings from this study further suggest that the popularity of self-driving busses decreases with the presence of a human steward on-board, or if they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes.

Using answers from 282 people in the Netherlands and Germany, we created a model that examines how much they trust self-driving vehicles and their interest in technology. The results show that public transport passengers currently prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus only for short trips. This is because the time spent traveling on the self-driving bus is valued at about twice as much as the time on the regular bus for short trips. Findings from this study further suggest that the popularity of self-driving buses decreases with the presence of a human steward on board or if they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes. People who show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology tend to view the self-driving buses more positively than others. Preferences for automated public transport services are expected to evolve as the transition from demonstration pilots to their regular operation occurs.",

We used different research methods, including looking at content and analyzing discussions, to find out what types of conspiracy theories appeared on Reddit during the Zika crisis. We also examined the conditions under which Zika conspiracy theories emerged and the specific ways these theories developed in online forums. Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis, reflecting their information needs and their distrust of formal sources of Zika information.

To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be primarily contingent on changes in muscle size. Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for maximization of both muscle size and strength. However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size affects a change in strength is surprisingly based on little evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.",

But this advice does not seem to be based on facts. We did not find any recommendation against strength training at a young age if it is well supervised with safety rules, medical clearance, proper instruction from a professional and progressive overload (gradual increase of stress on muscle and nervous system). Several studies showed many benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young people. Improved motor skills and body composition (muscle mass increased, fat mass decreased, healthier bone) were found in studies, especially if sport practice began during puberty. We can conclude that strength training is a safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents."

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press).

Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on highfidelity simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle. It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios. The state of the art in driving scenario generation, as adopted by some of the front-runners of the self-driving car industry, still relies on human input [1]. In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose poorly-engineered or poorly-trained self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.

This paper surveys strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation. Two types of strategies are examined: strategies to prevent the spread of superintelligence misinformation and strategies to correct it after it has spread. In general, misinformation can be difficult to correct, suggesting a high value of strategies to prevent it. The strategies proposed can be applied to lay public attention to superintelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus.",
        "prediction": "Superintelligence is a possible future form of artificial intelligence that would surpass human intelligence in many ways. If created, superintelligence could greatly change the world and have either positive or negative effects. There is a lot of debate about superintelligence, and unfortunately, there is also a lot of misinformation. This misinformation can lead to poor decisions by those who want to develop superintelligence and by those who influence them. This paper looks at ways to fight misinformation about superintelligence. It discusses two types of approaches: ways to stop misinformation from spreading and ways to fix it after it has spread. Generally, misinformation is hard to correct, so preventing it is very important. The suggested strategies can be used to inform the public about superintelligence, improve AI education, and promote agreement among experts.",

There have been a few methods proposed to detect different types of image editing operations in a single framework. However, all the operations have to be known a priori in the training phase. But, in real-forensics scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based method which can differentiate between different types of image editing operations. The proposed method classifies image patches in a pair-wise fashion as either similarly or differently processed using a deep siamese neural network. Once the network learns feature that can discriminate between different image editing operations, it can differentiate between different image editing operations not present in the training stage.

Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for maximization of both muscle size and strength. However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size affects a change in strength is surprisingly based on little evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.",

However, the idea that growing muscle size leads to increased strength has very little supporting evidence. We propose that these changes might actually be unrelated for several reasons: first, there is a weak relationship between muscle size changes and strength changes after training; second, muscle mass can decrease when people stop training, but strength often stays the same; and third, muscle growth can be similar whether using light or heavy weights, yet strength results can differ.",

Duration amounts to the sum total of the concentric, eccentric, and isometric components of a repetition, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT. Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s. From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",

Our results show that muscle growth is similar when using repetition durations between 0.5 and 8 seconds. Practically, this means a wide range of repetition durations can be used for muscle growth.

Many studies show that regular intense exercise benefits young people by improving motor skills and body composition, including more muscle, less fat, and better bone health, especially if they start sports early during puberty. Thus, strength training is generally safe and healthy for children and adolescents.",

In popular opinion, it is recommended to start intense physical activities like weight lifting and plyometrics (exercises like sprint and jumps) after adolescence. But this advice does not seem to be based on facts. We did not find any recommendation against strength training at a young age if it is well supervised with safety rules, medical clearance, proper instruction from a professional and progressive overload (gradual increase of stress on muscle and nervous system). Several studies showed many benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young people. Improved motor skills and body composition (muscle mass increased, fat mass decreased, healthier bone) were found in studies, especially if sport practice began during puberty. We can conclude that strength training is a safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents."

During such periods, the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain (rather than improve) physical performance. Similarly, certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods, namely athletes (during the competitive season and off-season) and military personnel (during deployment). In general populations, endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33–66% (as low as 13–26 minutes per session), as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained. Strength and muscle size (at least in younger populations) can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with as little as 1 session of strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity (relative load) is maintained; whereas, in older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 sessions per week and 2–3 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity.

The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing. Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only initiates the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance.

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6–15 RM loading range (15–40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects. Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.",

We suggest focusing on exercises that use both sides of the body and involve multiple joints with full movements. Key exercises should include at least one leg exercise like squats, one upper-body pulling exercise like pull-ups, and one upper-body pushing exercise like bench presses. You can use machines or free weights depending on your goals and what you prefer. It's more important to do enough volume each week rather than how often you train. We recommend at least four sets per muscle group each week using a weight that you can lift for 6 to 15 repetitions. Techniques like supersets and drop sets can significantly reduce training time while keeping the volume the same. These methods may help build muscle size more than strength, and more studies are needed to understand their long-term effects.

Moreover, scheduling may not only be handled by the clinician's assistant(s), creating challenges for clinicians to stay updated on any changes. Many clinicians today use a personal digital assistant (PDA) with a basic calendar. Our project called 'PalmOversite' shows the practicability of integrating enterprise appointment schedule information into a PDA calendar. This makes it easier for clinicians to access their schedule information."

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in a university-based resident clinic. Residents in internal medicine were given a CDSS suite based on PDA. Intervention residents were provided with a CDSS that had a prediction rule for assessing gastrointestinal risk related to NSAIDs and recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as standardized patients (SPs), who were equipped with musculoskeletal symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the study without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety outcomes of prescriptions given to standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A committee of clinicians who didn't know about the participant, intervention group assignment, or the baseline or follow-up data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was safe or unsafe. The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The main outcome measured the difference in unsafe prescribing between the intervention and control groups. At the beginning of the study, both groups had a similar proportion of unsafe prescriptions. (0.27 vs 0.29) After controlling for the baseline performance, it was found that those who received the CDSS suite prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more safely than those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to the CDSS through a PDA documented a more comprehensive assessment of gastrointestinal risk in patients. Moreover, the presence of the CDSS resulted in fewer unsafe treatment decisions compared to participants who did not have access to the CDSS."

To enable the transfer learning, a new task module takes the output of the last convolutional layer as input. The CNN trained on the source domain is then used to train the target network. It takes the output of the last convolutional layer of the source network and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain. The steering commands from the source and target network are merged and used for car control in the target domain. Two simulators were used to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method is more stable and safer for car control."

Additionally, for tasks involving service and manipulation, it is more effective to examine how the robot interacts with its surroundings at the point of contact using sensor-based control. This approach is preferred over specifying the positions and speeds of the robot's joints needed to perform those tasks.",

We discuss the policy implications of our model, highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation. Simultaneously, they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to self-select the narratives they want to be exposed to, both through active (confirmation bias) and passive (personalized news algorithms) self-reinforcing mechanisms. A precise theoretical understanding of such trade-offs is still largely missing. We introduce a stylized social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on the arrival of new information, while a fraction of participants display confirmation bias, enabling them to reject news that are incongruent with their pre-existing beliefs. We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation. Furthermore, the model results in states where unbiased agents behave \"as if\" they were biased, due to their biased neighbours effectively functioning as gatekeepers, restricting their access to free and diverse information. We derive analytic results for the distribution of individual agents’ beliefs, explicitly demonstrating the aforementioned trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity, which we further validate against US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming. Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by preserving information diversity in a social network.

In cloud computing, hackers can manipulate host and guest machine time. Guest virtual machines use computing resources provided by a physical machine called a host. Guest virtual machines are especially vulnerable to attacks coming from their host. That is why the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud is important. Any manipulation of such a timeline should be detected. In this paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in the cloud. A new algorithm is proposed to detect host and guest time manipulations and to correct or reject them. A simulator has been built for this purpose."

Nevertheless, the interesting issue of detecting image tampering and its related operations by using the same quantization matrix has not been fully investigated. Aiming to detect such forgery manipulations under the same quantization matrix, we propose a detection method by using shift-recompression -based reshuffle characteristic features. The learning classifiers are applied for classification. Our experimental results indicate that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and relevant manipulations with the same quantization matrix.",

JPEG images, a common type of image format, can be easily changed without leaving noticeable signs, making JPEG-based forensic methods important. Forensics refers to the application of scientific methods to investigate crime. In this context, it includes detecting signs of manipulation, such as double compression, interpolation (the process of estimating values between two known values), and rotation. However, the ability to identify image tampering that uses the same quantization matrix needs more research. A quantization matrix is a component used in compressing images to reduce file size while maintaining quality. To address this, we suggest a detection method that uses characteristics from shift-recompression, which is a technique for altering an image without significant changes. We apply learning classifiers, which are algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions or categorizations. Our test results show that this method is very effective in detecting image tampering and related modifications that occur using the same quantization matrix.",

Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycle training on muscle size and strength of the lower extremity and the possible mechanisms for increasing muscle size with cycle training. It is plausible that cycle training requires a longer period to significantly increase muscle size compared to typical resistance training due to a much slower hypertrophy rate. Cycle training induces muscle hypertrophy similarly between young and older age groups, while strength gain seems to favor older adults, which suggests that the probability for improving in muscle quality appears to be higher in older adults compared to young adults.

This review aims to explore how cycle training affects muscle size and strength in the lower body and the possible reasons for muscle size increase from cycle training. It is likely that cycle training takes a longer time to cause significant increases in muscle size compared to regular resistance training, which helps prepare and strengthen muscles, because the rate of muscle growth, known as hypertrophy, is much slower with cycling. Cycle training can lead to muscle hypertrophy similarly in both young and older individuals, but strength gains tend to be more pronounced in older adults, suggesting that older adults may have a greater potential for improving muscle quality than younger adults. For younger adults, higher-intensity intermittent cycling, which involves alternating periods of intense effort and rest, might be necessary to achieve strength gains. Additionally, the muscle hypertrophy that results from cycle training seems to be linked to positive changes in the balance of muscle proteins, which are essential for muscle structure and function.",

A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent.

This review tells about a kind of memory in skeletal muscle where growth (hypertrophy) is 'remembered' so that a muscle fiber that has grown larger in the past, but later became smaller, can grow back faster than muscles that have never been large before. A new model based on research can explain this idea, using the best ways to identify myonuclei, which are the nuclei or control centers of muscle cells. According to this model, muscle fibers that have never been trained before can attract myonuclei from activated satellite cells (which are special cells that help in muscle repair and growth) before they start to grow larger. Even if these muscles experience significant shrinkage (atrophy) later, they keep a higher number of myonuclei, and these nuclei appear to be shielded against the increased cell death (apoptosis) that happens in shrinking muscle tissue. Muscle fibers that have more myonuclei grow larger more quickly when they are put under extra force (overload exercise), so these nuclei serve as an important 'memory' of previous strength. This muscle memory might last a very long time in humans since myonuclei can remain stable for at least 15 years and may even last permanently. However, it is more difficult to recruit myonuclei in older adults. If this long-lasting muscle memory exists in humans, it suggests that starting strength training early on can be a good health recommendation.",

An often overlooked variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration. Duration amounts to the sum total of the concentric, eccentric, and isometric components of a repetition, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT. Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s. From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",

These include choosing the right exercises, the order in which they are done, the length of rest periods, how heavy the weights are, and the overall amount of weight lifted over time. An often overlooked aspect that might also affect muscle growth is the duration of each repetition. Duration refers to the total time taken during the concentric, eccentric, and isometric phases of a repetition. The concentric phase is when the muscle is shortening during the lift, the eccentric phase is when the muscle is lengthening while lowering the weight, and the isometric phase occurs when the muscle is contracted but not changing length. The total duration is influenced by the tempo, or speed, at which the repetition is done. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to find out if changing the duration of repetitions could enhance muscle growth in resistance training. Our results show that muscle growth outcomes are similar when using repetition durations of 0.5 to 8 seconds. From a practical perspective, it seems that a wide variety of repetition durations can be utilized if the main goal is to increase muscle size. Our findings suggest that performing repetitions very slowly, taking more than 10 seconds each, is less effective for muscle growth.

We can conclude that strength training is a safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents."

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6–15 RM loading range (15–40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects. Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.",

This review aimed to find the most effective ways to conduct strength training while saving time by evaluating research on quick training methods advanced training techniques and the importance of warm-up and stretching. To make strength training more time-efficient it is recommended to focus on exercises that work on both sides of the body and involve multiple joints with complete movements that engage both types of muscle actions known as eccentric and concentric. It is suggested to include at least one exercise for pressing down with the legs such as squats one pulling exercise for the upper body like pull-ups and one pushing exercise for the upper body like the bench press. These exercises can be done using exercise machines or free weights depending on the person's goals equipment availability and personal preference. The total amount of training per week is more important than how often training occurs and it is recommended to complete at least 4 sets per week for each muscle group using a loading range known as 6–15 RM which refers to how much weight can be lifted for a given number of repetitions. A higher number of repetitions between 15 to 40 can be done if the training is pushed to failure which means continuing until you cannot perform another repetition. Advanced training techniques such as supersets which involve doing two exercises back to back drop sets where the weight is reduced after each set and rest-pause training can cut training time in half compared to traditional methods while still keeping the same volume of work. However these methods may be more effective for increasing muscle size known as hypertrophy rather than building strength and further research is needed on the long-term effects of these training methods.

Intervention residents were provided with a CDSS that had a prediction rule for assessing gastrointestinal risk related to NSAIDs and recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as standardized patients (SPs), who were equipped with musculoskeletal symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the study without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety outcomes of prescriptions given to standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A committee of clinicians who didn't know about the participant, intervention group assignment, or the baseline or follow-up data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was safe or unsafe. The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The main outcome measured the difference in unsafe prescribing between the intervention and control groups. At the beginning of the study, both groups had a similar proportion of unsafe prescriptions. (0.27 vs 0.29) After controlling for the baseline performance, it was found that those who received the CDSS suite prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more safely than those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to the CDSS through a PDA documented a more comprehensive assessment of gastrointestinal risk in patients. Moreover, the presence of the CDSS resulted in fewer unsafe treatment decisions compared to participants who did not have access to the CDSS."

The system divides a web document into logical segments automatically, using information about the screen size, document structure, and content. The system also extracts summaries and overviews to make navigation easier. The system optimizes the use of the screen for information finding by showing the segments and structure of a web document."

Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on highfidelity simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle. It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios. The state of the art in driving scenario generation, as adopted by some of the front-runners of the self-driving car industry, still relies on human input [1]. In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose poorly-engineered or poorly-trained self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles. We show that by incorporating the generated scenarios into the training set of the self-driving policy, and by fine-tuning the policy using vision-based imitation learning we obtain safer self-driving behavior.",

Our model shows that even unbiased people can act biased because their biased neighbors limit their access to varied information. \n\nWe find clear results about how individual beliefs are shared. This shows the trade-off between confirmation bias and social connections. We also confirm our findings with data from U.S. counties on how Internet access affects beliefs about global warming. Our results suggest that a little confirmation bias can help people by keeping diverse information in a social network. However, too much confirmation bias can hurt accuracy as biased people limit information flow to small groups.",

We discuss the meaning of our model for policy and the downsides of myth-busting We suggest alternatives to fight misinformation. But misinformation is spread via social media because individuals can search for information that confirms their beliefs and personalized news algorithms may supply it. Theoretical understanding of the balance between opportunities and misinformation is incomplete. We introduce a stylized social learning model. In this model, most participants in a network update their beliefs based on new information, while others show confirmation bias and can reject news that differs from their beliefs. This simple confirmation bias mechanism can create lasting opinion polarisation. Besides, in the model, unbiased people behave “as if” biased because biased neighbours limit their access to diverse information. With our model, we show the trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity. We validated the model using the data on how internet access influences beliefs on global warming.

We trained our system with data collected from expert pilots, each with 6 to 8 years of flying experience. We made sure to follow rules to keep pedestrians safe during data collection. With the drone data collected, we successfully navigated roads without crashes, achieving an accuracy of 98.44%",
        "reference": "Current academic and industrial research is interested in autonomous vehicles. MAVNet computational efficiency enables the drone to fly up to 6m/sec. The solution is compared with other recent methods. Drones are increasingly used in the civilian and commercial domain and need to be autonomous. Governments set guidelines on the operation ceiling of civil drones. So, road-tracking based navigation is attracting interest. Researchers propose data-driven solutions allowing drones to autonomously navigate city streets, learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot. The algorithm, based on the Inception model, detects roads using tomographic reconstructions. The Inception model is an extension of classic image classification algorithms. The Inception-v3 architecture has better accuracy than many existing models of imitation learning. The data used for training the system was captured from the drone over urban streets, navigated by an expert pilot. Data collection requires special permission to ensure pedestrian security. The drone can navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting; its accuracy is 98.44%."

An often overlooked variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration. Duration amounts to the sum total of the concentric, eccentric, and isometric components of a repetition, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT. Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s. From a practical standpoint it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",

Another important factor that people often forget is how long each repetition takes. This duration includes the time for lifting, lowering, and holding the weight. We did a study to see if changing how long each repetition takes can help muscle growth during resistance training. Our results show that muscle growth is similar with repetition durations between 0.5 to 8 seconds. This means you can use a variety of repetition lengths if your goal is to grow muscles. However, training with very slow repetitions over 10 seconds seems less effective for muscle growth. More controlled studies are needed to be sure about this finding.",

Common sense advices call for late inception of intense, strength training-related activities, like weight lifting and plyometrics, which are usually postponed at the end of the growth age, even among sport practitioners. However, such advices seem to have a mainly anecdotal nature. Current literature does not seem to have any particular aversion against the practice of strength training by children and adolescents, provided that some safety rules are followed, like medical clearance, proper instruction from a qualified professional and progressive overload. At the same time, several studies provide consistent findings supporting the benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young subjects. Improved motor skills and body composition, in terms of increased fat free mass, reduced fat mass and enhanced bone health, have been extensively documented, especially if sport practice began early, when the subjects were pubescent. It can be therefore concluded that strength training is a relatively safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents.",

However, this advice is mostly based on personal stories. Research does not have a strong rule against strength training for children and teens if safety measures are followed. This includes getting medical approval, having proper training, and increasing difficulty gradually. Many studies show that young people benefit from doing intense physical activities. They improve their motor skills and body composition. This means more muscle, less fat, and better bone health, especially if they start sports early during puberty. So, strength training is safe and healthy for children and teens.",

In popular opinion, it is recommended to start intense physical activities like weight lifting and plyometrics (exercises like sprint and jumps) after adolescence. But this advice does not seem to be based on facts. We did not find any recommendation against strength training at a young age if it is well supervised with safety rules, medical clearance, proper instruction from a professional and progressive overload (gradual increase of stress on muscle and nervous system). Several studies showed many benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young people. Improved motor skills and body composition (muscle mass increased, fat mass decreased, healthier bone) were found in studies, especially if sport practice began during puberty.

        "source": "Nearly every physically active person encounters periods in which the time available for exercise is limited (e.g., personal, family, or business conflicts). During such periods, the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain (rather than improve) physical performance. Similarly, certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods, namely athletes (during the competitive season and off-season) and military personnel (during deployment). In general populations, endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33–66% (as low as 13–26 minutes per session), as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained. Strength and muscle size (at least in younger populations) can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with as little as 1 session of strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity (relative load) is maintained; whereas, in older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 sessions per week and 2–3 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity. Our primary conclusion is that exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time, despite relatively large reductions in exercise frequency and volume.",
        "prediction": "Many active people have times when they cannot exercise much due to personal or work issues. During these times, the goal of training is to maintain physical performance instead of improving it. This applies to athletes during their seasons and to military personnel during their deployments. General endurance can be kept up for 15 weeks if training goes down to 2 sessions each week or if exercise volume is cut by 33-66%. This means 13-26 minutes per session, as long as the intensity of the workout stays the same. For strength and muscle size, younger people can maintain this for 32 weeks with just 1 session of strength training each week and 1 set per exercise while keeping intensity. Older people may need 2 sessions per week and 2-3 sets per exercise to maintain muscle size, also while keeping intensity. The main takeaway is that exercise intensity is crucial for maintaining physical performance even with less frequent and shorter workouts.",

Some have claimed that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition. It has even been postulated that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients. The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing. Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only initiates the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance. Several researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize training-related muscular adaptations. However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise ‘window’ can vary according to a number of factors. Not only is nutrient timing research open to question in terms of applicability, but recent evidence has directly challenged the classical view of the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake with respect to anabolism.",

The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements (i.e. both eccentric and concentric muscle actions), and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 6–15 RM loading range (15–40 repetitions can be used if training is performed to volitional failure). Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects. Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.",

You can use machines or free weights based on your goals and preferences. The total amount of training is more important than how often you train.

Advanced techniques like supersets, drop sets, and rest-pause training can cut training time in half while keeping the volume. These methods may improve muscle size better than strength, and more studies are needed to explore their long-term effects.

Meta-regression analysis of non-volume-equated studies showed a significant effect favoring higher frequencies, although the overall difference in magnitude of effect between frequencies of 1 and 3+ days per week was modest.
