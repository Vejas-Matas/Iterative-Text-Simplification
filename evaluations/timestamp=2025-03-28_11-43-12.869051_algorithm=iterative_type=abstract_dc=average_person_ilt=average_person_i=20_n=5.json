      "prediction": "Abstract   Novel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles. This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.",

Some of the mobile carriers combines context-aware technologies or involve into wireless network environments to make effective use through the combination of learning scenarios and technologies, and then provide students new learning experiences differed from the past learning. In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning.",
