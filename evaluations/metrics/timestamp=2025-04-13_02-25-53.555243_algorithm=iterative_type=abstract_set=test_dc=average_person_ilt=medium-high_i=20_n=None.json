Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information. Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning.",

      "prediction": "Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information. Dynamic obstacles require the robot to plan its path again, which can cause delays or collisions. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning.",

In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features. For this, we consider the bottleneck features, which have been successfully applied to deep neural network (DNN) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. When learning the bottleneck features to catch, we first exploit the motor on/off state data as supplementary information in addition to the acoustic features as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling. Then, the second DNN for primary acoustic modeling employs both the bottleneck features tossed from the first DNN and the acoustics features. When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.",
