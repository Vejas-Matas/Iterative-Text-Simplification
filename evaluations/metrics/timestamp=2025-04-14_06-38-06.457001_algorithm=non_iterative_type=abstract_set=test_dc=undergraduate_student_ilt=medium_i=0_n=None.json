This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice.",

Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost.

When learning the bottleneck features to catch, we first exploit the motor on/off state data as supplementary information in addition to the acoustic features as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling. Then, the second DNN for primary acoustic modeling employs both the bottleneck features tossed from the first DNN and the acoustics features.

Since conventional computer-assisted language learning is often boring, it exploits a cyber pet game to increase the learner\u2019s interest. M-CALL runs on a personal digital assistant with public wireless LAN for mobile learning. It grows a cyber pet by solving problems of Korean language learning. Korean Proficiency Test (KPT), a nationally certified Korean language test, was used as problem sets. It consists of cyber pet game, mobile learning courseware, mobile learning system, and mobile tutoring. It provides various functions for Korean language learning. Currently, the prototype M-CALL was designed and partly implemented between mobile PDA and personal computer.",

The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to dexterously manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high throughput systems (HTS). The resulting drone could augment existing HTS operations. The 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm and gripper design are presented. Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given.",

      "prediction": "Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems. These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS). The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.",
