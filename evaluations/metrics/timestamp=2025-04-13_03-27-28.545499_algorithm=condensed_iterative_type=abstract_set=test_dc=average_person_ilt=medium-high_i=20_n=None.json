According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. The myonuclei are protected from damage when the muscle atrophies, and this protection helps them to be retained. Muscles that have more myonuclei grow faster when exercised harder, showing a memory of their past strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years, and early strength training is recommended as a public health advice.",
