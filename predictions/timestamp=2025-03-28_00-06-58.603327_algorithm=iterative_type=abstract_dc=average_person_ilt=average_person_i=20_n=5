Abstract   Novel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles. This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be done from the AEGIS App, such as finding the closest facilities and firefighting support, checking the weather, and viewing important fire information. A key feature of the AEGIS App is the use of a digital assistant named Cortana to help with tasks, allowing users to access information through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.
In recent years, mobile technologies have developed and applied in education fields, and some mobile emerging carriers with mobile technologies include a personal digital assistant (PDA), smart phone, and e-book. Some mobile carriers use context-aware technologies to provide students with new learning experiences that are different from the past learning. Research has shown that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. Using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods has become a key part of mobile learning. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning.
This paper proposes an electrophysiological wireless patient monitoring system which integrates a Wireless ECG signal transmitter, GPS device and a mobile phone to acquire physiological signals and transmit them to a local server via Bluetooth wireless technology. Four types of units were designed for wireless communication: a control center, a local monitor, mobile devices, and a web page for patients and doctors. The use of various monitor units is created to fulfill different medical personnel requirements and wishes. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient.
As various kinds of output devices emerged, such as high-resolution printers or a display of PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), the importance of high-quality resolution conversion has been increasing. This paper proposes a new method for enlarging image with high quality. One of the main issue with image enlargement is the appearance of jagged edges. To remedy this problem, we propose a new interpolation method, which uses a special computer algorithm to determine the best pixel values. The experimental results are shown and evaluated. The effectiveness of our methods is discussed by comparing with the conventional methods.
A significative percentage of the human population suffer from impairments in their capacity to distinguish or even see colours. For them, everyday tasks like navigating through a train or metro network map becomes demanding. We present a novel technique for extracting colour information from everyday natural stimuli and presenting it to visually impaired users in a way that is easy for them to hear. This technique was implemented inside a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) portable device. In this implementation, colour information is extracted from the input image and organised according to how people categorise colours. This information is subsequently converted into sound and sent to the user via speakers or headphones. In the original implementation, it is possible for the user to send its feedback to reconfigure the system, however several features such as these were not implemented because the current technology is limited.We are confident that the full implementation will be possible in the near future as PDA technology improves.
