Abstract   Novel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles. This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, search for closest facilities, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas stations and evacuation sites). The AEGIS App is powered by a digital assistant named Cortana, allowing voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.
In recent years, mobile technologies have developed and applied in education fields, and some mobile devices, such as smartphones and e-readers, are examples of emerging mobile technologies. Some mobile devices use wireless networks to access new technologies and learning opportunities. Previous studies have shown that mobile learning is an effective way for students to interact with educational content and achieve their learning goals. In mobile learning, using mobile devices with learning strategies has become a key part of education for many students. The study found that students who learned competitively performed better than those who did not. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning.
This paper proposes an electrophysiological wireless patient monitoring system which integrates a Wireless ECG signal transmitter, GPS device and a mobile phone to acquire physiological signals and transmit them to a local server via Bluetooth wireless technology. Four different types of monitoring units were designed to enable wireless communication, including a control center, a local monitor unit, mobile devices (personal digital assistant; PDA), and a Web page (for both patient and doctor). The various monitor units are designed to meet the needs of different healthcare professionals. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient.
As various kinds of output devices emerged, such as high-resolution printers or a display of PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), the importance of high-quality resolution conversion has been increasing. This paper proposes a new method for enlarging image with high quality. One of the main issues with image enlargement is the appearance of jagged edges. To remedy this problem, we propose a new interpolation method, which uses a neural network to improve the quality of the enlarged image. The experimental results are shown and evaluated. The effectiveness of our methods is compared to traditional methods.
Many people struggle to distinguish or see colours. For them, everyday tasks like navigating through a train or metro network map becomes demanding. We present a new way to help visually impaired people by turning colours into sound. Colour information is extracted from the input image and sorted into categories based on how humans typically group colours. This technique was implemented inside a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) portable device. In the original version, users could adjust the system with their feedback, but some features were left out due to current technology limitations. We are confident that the full implementation will be possible in the near future as PDA technology improves.
