In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of industry and academia.
With the ever increasing number of drones being used in many places, autonomy in these systems too.
Due to government regulations, road tracking is gaining interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a solution that uses imitation and data to navigating through city streets by learning to fly like an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast A deep learning model with 39 layers, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experienced pilots.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that low risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process.
With a lot of data from drones, we have been able to navigate roads safely, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
The efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.
