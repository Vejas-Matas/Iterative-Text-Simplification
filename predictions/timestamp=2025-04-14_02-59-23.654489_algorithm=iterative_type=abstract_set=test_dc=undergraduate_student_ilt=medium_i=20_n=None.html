Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a 2D map <strong> isn&amp;#x27;t enough</strong> since they can step over objects and need height information. Considering dynamic obstacles <strong> adds</strong> complexity, <strong> as</strong> they can <strong> cause the robot</strong> to <strong> replan its path and avoid collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create prediction <strong> maps that allow for efficient path planning.</strong> We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Perception of the environment is <strong> necessary</strong> for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most <strong> robots (humanoids</strong> and wheeled <strong> robots)</strong> rely on planar regions. For <strong> humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics),</strong> a 2D map is not sufficient <strong> because</strong> they can step over and onto <strong> objects, so they</strong> need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> bring</strong> another level of complexity, <strong> because it</strong> can lead to necessary replanning or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low <strong> processor</strong> cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

This paper presents</strong> a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid <strong> robots. On/off</strong> state of the motor is <strong> used to find</strong> relevant input features. <strong> Bottleneck features</strong> have been successfully applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR) <strong> systems based on deep neural networks (DNN). The</strong> motor on/off state data <strong> and</strong> acoustic features <strong> are used</strong> as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling. <strong> The</strong> second DNN for primary acoustic modeling <strong> uses</strong> both bottleneck features from the first DNN and <strong> acoustic ones. The</strong> proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, experimental results show that improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems. <strong></strong></div>

It <strong> includes a</strong> game, <strong> a</strong> learning <strong> platform,</strong> and <strong> a tutoring system.</strong> It provides various functions for Korean language learning. Currently, the prototype M-CALL was designed and partly <strong>implemented.</strong></div>

Manipulations can be as subtle as <strong> changing the</strong> source <strong> code, which is the programming instructions,</strong> or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. To respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, algorithms <strong> are used</strong> to detect phishing websites based on their content, employing a data set consisting of 17,992 phishing attacks targeting 159 different brands. The results of the experiments using different approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate. <strong></strong></div>
