This paper proposes an electrophysiological wireless patient monitoring system which integrates a Wireless ECG signal transmitter, GPS device and a mobile phone to acquire physiological signals and transmit them to a local server via Bluetooth wireless technology. Four types of monitor units were designed for wireless communication: a control center, a local monitor, mobile devices, and a web page for patients and doctors. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient.
As various kinds of output devices emerged such as high-resolution printers or a display of PDA(Personal Digital Assistant) the importance of high-quality resolution conversion has been increasing. This paper proposes a new method for enlarging image with high quality. One of the largest problems on image enlargement is the jaggy edges become distorted. To remedy this problem we propose a new interpolation method which uses a special computer algorithm to determine the best values for the new pixels. The experimental results are shown and evaluated. The effectiveness of our methods is discussed by comparing with the conventional methods.
A significative percentage of the human population suffer from impairments in their capacity to distinguish or even see colours. For them everyday tasks becomes demanding. We present a novel technique for extracting colour information from everyday natural stimuli and presenting it to visually impaired users as pleasant non-invasive sound. This technique was implemented inside a Personal Digital Assistant portable device. Colour information is extracted from images and grouped into categories based on how people perceive colours. This information is subsequently converted into sound and sent to the user via speakers or headphones. In the original implementation it is possible for the user to send its feedback to reconfigure the system however several features such as these were not implemented because the current technology is limited We are confident that the full implementation will be possible in the near future as PDA technology improves.
Inappropriate use of medicines increases the risk of hospital admissions for the elderly. Not only does this lead to unnecessary suffering for the patients but also incurs a great financial cost to the society. A medicine decision support system in a PDA with a barcode reader helps patients and healthcare workers keep track of medicines and prevent bad interactions. Focusing on the elderly our aim was to evaluate if a mobile medicine decision support system with a barcode reader is useful and user-friendly for nurses in home care. The participants received a comprehensive overview from the patients medicine use and noted drug-drug interactions therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people. Our findings show that most nurses found the system useful and easy to use. The nurses regarded that the decision support system increased prevention and safety was useful and user-friendly. Therefore this decision support system might be a useful tool for district nurses.
access to patient appointment schedules can help clinicians manage time and problems better. Many healthcare organizations use complex scheduling systems that are hard for clinicians to access. Also staff other than the clinician's personal assistant(s) may manage scheduling making it difficult for clinicians to stay informed of changes. Many a clinician today uses a personal digital assistant containing basic calendaring functionality Our “PalmOversite” project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating enterprise appointment schedule information into a PDA calendar making schedule information much more readily available to the clinician.
Partners In Health and its sister organization in Lima Peru Socios En Salud treat a majority of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis MDR-TB patients in Peru in conjunction with the Peruvian National TB Program NTP Monthly bacteriology tests which must be collected from health establishments located across this major city are an integral part of this treatment Currently a SES employee visits each health establishment to collect this information by hand process it and type it into an electronic medical record system paper we describe the development and implementation of a personal digital assistant PDA-based electronic system to collect verify and upload monthly bacteriology data into the PIH-EMR After an initial implementation period we conducted a baseline assessment in two areas and then introduced the electronic system in one of them while the other area continued with the old system during the same period We performed a pilot study to test the use of this system The PDA-based system processed data in 6.2 days which was significantly faster than the baseline 54.8 days and control 64.4 days It was also able to reduce the frequency of discrepancy from 10.1 to 2.8 and receive positive feedback from the users Finally the system’s cost would be recuperated in three months from time savings due to increased work efficiency This system will be the subject of a larger study to determine its impact on delays errors and costs
In order to facilitate knowledge transfer between specialists and generalists and between experts and novices and to promote interdisciplinary communication there is a need to provide methods and tools for doing so This interdisciplinary research team developed and evaluated a decision support tool DST on a personal digital assistant PDA for cardiac tele-triage/tele-consultation when the presenting problem was chest pain We used a combination of two methods to develop the decision support tool understanding how people work and design the interface in a way that fits their needs A pilot clinical trial was conducted at a specialized cardiac hospital over a 3-month period During this time the DST was used by the nine nursing coordinators who provide continuous phone consultation for cardiac issues 24/7 This clinical trial validated the design and demonstrated its usefulness to advanced cardiac care nurses its potential for use by nurses less experienced in cardiac care and for its potential use in an interdisciplinary team environment

In monitoring a patient's real-time vital signs through Body Area Networks BAN rich data sources are communicated to medical practitioners. It is essential that data is delivered in a timely and relevant manner. In this paper a system is designed for patients with cardiac disorders with an emphasis on the design of the sensing device and communication scheme chosen. Several existing wearable physiological devices Patient Sensing Device PSD used in the Healthcare systems are bulky in design and are not flexible and comfortable for the elderly patients. Presented is a unique flexible as well as detachable PSD for the comfort of patients. Also discussed is a model for transmission storage and processing of patient related data which ensures periodic logging of patient data without saturating communication networks. A prototype has been created to transmit a patient's ECG signal and body temperature with the ability to add other vital signs in the future. Communication between a mobile smart-phone and the ECG and temperature acquisition apparatus is implemented Bluetooth. The presented Data Management System Periodic Model DMS PM is designed to manage wireless interface of sensor units with the patient database at a Medical Service Provider MSP through a Personal Digital Assistant PDA or a Smart phone making use of the existing GSM network.
Advancement of wireless and mobile technology has enabled additional platforms to support learning in a single learning space. Current trend integrates usage of mobile terminals such as smart PDA in a learning system. Such devices can communicate with wireless mobile terminal and realize the intelligence exchange with its surroundings [1]. A system called One Day Trip is used to help overseas students learn Japanese in real-life situations using a personal digital assistant. This paper proposes the implementation with Knowledge Management concepts in the system to aid the teacher and learners in the learning environment.
In recent years we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking These applications have been written for a special type of digital assistant an alternative to other hardware The Cybiko device was recently discontinued As a result these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful Instead of porting each application to individual platforms which would prove to be extremely time consuming we created the Vassar College Messaging System This layer abstracts the Cybiko networking structure and interface allowing Cybiko applications to be ported to other platforms with minimal code alteration
Unlike many other classes of hardware, smartcards do not have the ability to communicate securely with the user. Deprived of means to keep the owner informed, the positive properties of smartcards are difficult to utilize. We explore the area at the border between smartcards and other, more powerful and thus more useful machines. On the other side of this border we find the Personal Digital Assistant : our view, to be useful as an extension of the user's private sphere, a machine must have enough functionality to create trustworthy digital signatures for the user. A less resourceful machine can merely act as a memory prothesis, helping the owner remembering addresses and phone are : designed to be tamper resistant, and as such they seem ideal as a minimal machine. However, trustworthy digital signatures can not be created by smartcards alone, simply because the user does not know what is given to the card for order to be trusted--that is, being able to make trustworthy digital signatures--a smartcard must be supported by some infrastructure outside the card proper. We explore what must be included in such an infrastructure, and demonstrate that trustworthy digital signatures can in fact be made using a standard argue that based on this fact, nontrivial distributed systems can be constructed by utilizing smartcards; a nontrivial system is one where holders of smartcards are first class citizens. Asserting that a smartcard can act as a trusted machine gives new opportunities for designers of user-centric that smartcards are here to stay, finding ways to apply them in constructive manners is prudent.
In this paper we present the main features of a system that we have developed and that provides a new kind of tele-assistance service to elderly people.apart from the functionalities offered by the current tele-assistance services also provides a high quality anywhere and at any time assistance. We rate the assistance as high quality because it can monitor vital signs and detect any problems in real time sending alerts automatically. AINGERU offers three main functionalities assistance anywhere and at any time monitoring of vital signs and remote monitoring by authorized people. We achieve the functionalities by using a combination of digital assistants wireless communication and web technologies.
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a personal digital assistant (PDA)–based clinical decision support system (CDSS) on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescribing safety in the outpatient setting:\n\nThe design was a randomized, controlled trial conducted in a university-based resident clinic. Internal medicine residents received a PDA-based CDSS suite. For intervention residents, the CDSS included a prediction rule for NSAID-related gastrointestinal risk assessment and treatment recommendations. Unannounced standardized patients (SPs) trained to portray musculoskeletal symptoms presented to study physicians. Safety outcomes were assessed from the prescriptions given to the SPs. Each prescription was reviewed by a committee of clinicians blinded to participant, intervention group assignment, and baseline or follow-up :[108], \n\nPrescriptions were judged as safe or unsafe. The main outcome measure was the differential change in unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs for the intervention versus the control :[135], At baseline, the mean proportion of cases per physician with unsafe prescriptions for the two groups was similar (0.27 vs. 0.29, p ≥ 0.05). After adjusting for initial performance, the group that received the CDSS made fewer mistakes when prescribing NSAIDs compared to the control group. Participants provided with a PDA-based CDSS for NSAID prescribing made fewer unsafe treatment decisions than participants without the CDSS.
Recently pedestrian navigation has been studied by many researchers which provides pedestrians with a similar function of car navigation On the other hand a 3D map is used in city and landscape planning and other engineering fields as a tool for simulation The 3D maps will give more intuitive information compared to conventional 2-dimensional 2D ones In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on 3D maps and describe technologies required and its use situations Secondly we compare effectiveness of 2D and 3D maps for navigation by object search experiments under conditions 3D maps with and without texture display sizes corresponding to a mobile phone and PDA The results showed that 3D maps with features on a phone and 3D maps without features on a PDA were better than 2D maps in searching and accuracy
Mobile agents are a competitive concept of client-server computing and are especially suitable in mobile environments, that are characterized by low bandwidth communication facilities and ad hoc connection/disconnection to stationary systems. They can be used for information retrieval and information filtering. Mobile agents are created on mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, and can perform tasks on other systems over the network. One transmission channel for these itinerant agents is email. This paper introduces Active M 3 as an example of an active mail framework, which can be regarded as a first approach in authoring mobile agents in a graphical interactive manner. Active M 3 integrates two known concepts: active mail and multimedia mail.


Dr. Who is a Microsoft research project aiming at creating a speech-centric multimodal interaction framework which serves as the foundation for the NET natural user interface The paper discusses MiPad's design implementation work in progress and preliminary user study in comparison to the existing pen-based PDA interface MiPad is the application prototype that demonstrates compelling user advantages for wireless personal digital assistant PDA devices MiPad fully integrates continuous speech recognition CSR and spoken language understanding SLU to enable users to accomplish many common tasks using a multimodal interface and wireless technologies It tries to solve the problem of pecking with tiny styluses or typing on minuscule keyboards in today's PDAs Unlike a cellular phone MiPad avoids speech-only interaction It incorporates a built-in microphone that activates whenever a field is selected As a user taps the screen or uses a built-in roller to navigate the tapping action narrows the number of possible instructions for spoken word understanding MiPad currently runs on a Windows CE Pocket PC with a Windows 2000 machine where speech recognition is performed The Dr Who CSR engine uses a sophisticated language understanding system that breaks down speech into clear instructions
Little is known about how new mobile applications emerge in commercial environments. Research in the sociology of technology suggests that the evolution of new applications is a process of social interaction between multiple people. Established technological communities try to impose their own definitions of key problems and solutions on new mobile technology, forcing newer players to redefine a new application area.
In the ubiquitous environment, mobile terminals like personal digital assistant or cellular phone are used to access the Web. We implemented the procedures in a ubiquitous/universal passive viewer (u-PaV) system that transforms Web content into passive viewing content that is especially useful for mobile terminals. Extracting images and text from Web content, u-PaV generates a popular multimedia format. However, mobile and desktop terminals have some differences that affect how content is displayed, such as screen resolution and sound quality. Moreover, when changing the access style between interactive and passive, the presentation should be adjusted for the terminal type because the lacking information is usually not perceived after transformation. To adjust the play style of Web content to the terminal type, we developed a method for visual presentation. We add a color to the background of the screen to show the emotional tone of the web page. We also emphasize the subject of the content by the logotype of the keyword. Third, we segment the picture of the content into pieces and present one after another using visual effects. These procedures can be applied to any type of terminal.
We have developed two-way location aware system, named as “The Beijing Explorer”, which exchanged location information and users' situations in real time using a PDA and GPS. Users can see their position and their chats on the screen of a PDA using the system real-timely. The system was used for the guidance of the Palace Museum (Forbidden City) in Beijing, China. We carried on experiments two times using the system. The results of experiments show that the service using positioning data and sharing contents were valuable and interesting. The correct positioning information is important for the guidance system.
A truly personal machine, called a private machine and implemented as a Personal Digital Assistant is fundamentally different from traditional machines. It is personal and private in an unprecedented manner, and its modus operandi is such that network and power failures will not be rare. Designing systems that treat PDAs as important users is crucial. Users electronic money, passwords, and access keys should be stored in their PDAs and remain under their control. Ownership and control of these assets and the media that store and communicate them should remain with the user. This must be reflected in the design of systems for private introduction of the open-ended argument to describe the design strategy we used for designing a system that is designed to reveal information to the user as opposed to hide it. We argue and show that when systems are designed this way, the user a human is better able to control the system and his personal data, as he can make better decisions than the system itself based on qualitative assessment of the provided information. The system we have designed and implemented under this design is presented and discussed.
Depression is under recognized in a variety of pediatric settings. The purpose of this paper is to develop and evaluate a tool to help nurses screen for depression in children and teens. Three key aspects are: choosing a depression test, integrating the test into the PDA, and evaluating its effectiveness through user testing and feedback. Only one third of eligible patients were screened. Twenty percent of those screened were identified as at risk for mood disorder. The barriers to screening included a lack of time, knowledge, and resources, as well as cultural and technical issues. Ideas for improving education, research, and implementation of PDA-based screening are explored.
This study explored the potential of the application of wireless and mobile computing technologies to be used in improving the efficiency of patient care and education and future developments in information and communication technologies to support healthcare professionals and medical students in healthcare research medical education and training. The study used a systematic review of existing research from various online databases including EMBASE MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. Today more than 50% of healthcare professionals and medical students are using Personal Digital Assistant with expected growth of more than 75% by year-end 2007. In addition wireless and mobile computing technologies allows Personal Digital Assistant to connect directly to networks or the Internet. Studies should evaluate mobile computing technologies to see if they can save time in patient care. Wireless and mobile computing technologies is only beginning to take its first step in improving patient care and education. They have shown a positive impact on patient safety health care efficiency and ultimately patient satisfaction.
Nursing students can learn many things through practical training by experiencing actual medical practice and by coming in contact with patients. Practical training is an effective way for nursing students to learn. Moreover at hospitals which are important training facilities medical safety does not allow electronic learning tools. So we created a learning support environment that facilitates the imagination of nursing techniques and enables effective preparation review and learning at anytime and anywhere using a portable digital assistant PDA device for practical training. This paper describes the digital nursing dictionary we created and its evaluation.

This device has two work modes: ”native” and ”remote”. It also can communicate with monitor center through phone, computer cable, memory card, and mobile device.


Mobile services and personal data need better protection. Speaker recognition is of interest for its simple and convenient features. In this paper, a robust speaker recognition system which facilitates reliable authentication with multi-channel voices is presented. A large collection of audio recordings from various devices is used to test the system.
This paper presents a method to generate unique and nevertheless highly random pseudonyms in a distributed environment. More precisely, each user can generate a pseudonym on their own device, such as a smart card or digital assistant. There is no need for any information interchange between issuing parties or global data especially keys except unique identifiers for each user and each device of the system. He can prove he generated the pseudonym without revealing his identity and can reveal his identity by sharing the pseudonym. Whereas the verifier of a disclosed pseudonym can be sure that the presenter of the pseudonym is the holder of the pseudonym the person which originally generated it. The user's and device identifiers are used to generate unique pseudonyms and are stored in the pseudonym in encrypted form.
In todayu0027s mobile information society location-based services play an increasingly important role. These services are to be accessed by users with a mobile end device for the use of city maps route planning navigation or traffic information. Mobile end devices however do not have computing power or storage capacity comparable to that of a personal computer or laptop. This paper outlines the experience gained in the development of a prototype for route computation in public transport networks to be used on a personal digital assistant. Breaking down the route calculation into smaller steps helps reduce the work on the mobile device.
DIANE is a digital assistant that helps doctors quickly access hospital information, such as medical records and staff data. The quick access could be achieved by implementing face recognition and live streaming as part of the digital assistant.
Digital assistants are emerging to become more prevalent in our daily lives. In interacting with these assistants, users may perform several tasks in a short time.

Big data, the enhanced ability to collect, store and analyze previously unimaginable quantities of data in tremendous speed and with negligible costs, delivers immense benefits in marketing efficiency, healthcare, environmental protection, national security and more. The principles of data minimization and purpose limitation are struggling to keep up with the rapid changes in big data technological and business reality. As we increasingly interact with these artificial agents in unsupervised settings, with no human mediators, this raises questions about the legal and philosophical implications of their behavior. The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding data driven ethical dilemmas, such as privacy, fairness and discrimination. The machine may exacerbate, enable, or simply draw attention to the ethical challenges, but it is humans who must be held accountable. Policymakers should seek to devise agreed-upon guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling. Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; criteria for calling out unethical, if not illegal, behavior; categories of privacy and non-privacy harms; and strategies for empowering individuals through access to data in intelligible form.
Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups however these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. We conducted a study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including those who are native and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the device. The findings show that compared with their counterparts the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device. It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs. This study can provide valuable insights for designing better voice assistants that work with multiple languages.
the smart speakers cannot distinguish human voice from machine voice \nfigure out whether a human or a machine is sending voice commands to the speaker \nto prevent such machine-voice based attacks to a smart speaker in absence of residents we propose a system consisting of a speaker and a microphone array to detect the existence of a human nearby supposing it can be incorporated in a smart speaker in the future
As smart speakers with voice interaction capability permeate continuously in the world, more and more people will gradually get used to the new interaction medium–voice. Although speech recognition natural language processing have been greatly improved over the past few years, users still may encounter errors from time to time like “cannot understand”, “no requested audio resource (such as music)”, which can frustrate users. Therefore, when an error message is reported, it is vital that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper response. However, currently the response strategies adopted by leading smart speaker brands in China differed mainly on two dimensions: “apology or not”. We looked at how users prefer smart speakers to respond when they make mistakes, such as not understanding what was said or not being able to play music. Two variables were measured: how satisfied users were and how sincere they thought the response was. The results showed that participants were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speakers apologized in both error scenarios. In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no significant impact on the perception of satisfaction and sincerity. But in the “cannot understand” scenario, humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity.
A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process specifically drug molecules compounds in high throughput screening libraries chemical building blocks and nondrug molecules Significant differences were observed between the pharmacophore profiles of drug molecules and those of screening compounds which show a close connection to the profiles of non-drug compounds It is suggested that the analysis of pharmacophore profiles could be used as an additional tool for the property-based optimization of compound selection and library design processes thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects
Annotation of bioassay protocols using semantic web vocabulary is a way to make experiment descriptions machine-readable. Protocols are communicated using concise scientific English, which precludes most kinds of analysis by software algorithms. Given the availability of a sufficiently expressive ontology, some or all of the pertinent information can be captured by asserting a series of facts, expressed as semantic web triples (subject, predicate, object). Assays can be analyzed and compared in different ways, similar to how other parts of the drug discovery process are evaluated. The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) has been previously designed for this express purpose, and provides a layered hierarchy of meaningful terms which can be linked to.
Next generation sequencing produces vast amounts of data, with millions of reads from hundreds of samples. Bioinformatic analysis is typically done with the help of open source tools. This situation leaves bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools, manage the data files and meta-information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.
Special software was used to find patterns between causes of illness and traditional Chinese medicine. The classic Apriori algorithm is useful to mine cases of influenza treated by traditional Chinese medicine.
Identifying antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria in metagenomics samples is essential for public health and food safety. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype and phenotype in humans and other species. a statistical method to estimate the genetic makeup of multiple bacterial types has reduced the false discovery rate and mean absolute error in identifying genetic variations.
The CRISPR/Cas9 system was recently developed as a powerful and flexible technology for targeted genome editing: changing the genetic code and controlling gene expression without changing the code. These applications require the design of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that work well and accurately. However, this remains challenging, as it requires the consideration of many criteria.
The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation. Improving the health of future generations could help public health goals and if successful be considered a public benefit. However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. The current discussion about future generations' moral obligations suggests that women might be morally required to use IVF. Enhancing future generations will be gendered unless the artificial womb is developed. These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective of both women and men. Despite the lack of a unified feminist conclusion in the discussions about the merits and risks of human genome modification there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
CRISPR-Cas is a tool that is widely used for gene editing. However, unexpected off-target effects may occur due to ongoing enzyme activity. Anti-CRISPR proteins, which are powerful molecules that inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system, may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene therapy. Additionally, more in-depth research on these proteins would help researchers to better understand the relationship between bacteria and phages. Therefore, it is necessary to collect and integrate data on various types of anti-CRISPRs.
CRISPR has become a hot research area ever since its advent for its efficiency and specificity in editing almost every section of DNA sequences. Based on its function of gene perturbation, a variety of gene editing techniques have been developed to achieve different aims. Genes in a DNA strand can be edited by being removed, repaired, or turned on. The high efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents preparation and the easiness of experiment conduction make it now a powerful tool of high-content screen.
The CRISPR-Cpf1 system has been successfully applied in genome editing. However, target efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system varies. Using computers and machine learning, a model was created to predict how well a particular gRNA will work. the first web service application, CRISPR-DT (CRISPR DNA Targeting), to help users design optimal gRNAs for the CRISPR-Cpf1 system by considering both target efficiency and specificity is available.
Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via VANETs (vehicle-to-vehicle networks). VANETs (vehicle-to-vehicle networks) create new risks for self-driving cars that make them more difficult to control. These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS). The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.
Self-driving vehicle technologies are progressing rapidly and are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation. One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles. When self-driving vehicles are in the same area, they might collide or become stuck, making the ride uncomfortable or unsafe. In this paper, we look at how self-driving cars can safely merge onto roads with multiple lanes. We present a safe protocol for merging vehicles, where self-driving cars use communication and their own sensors to work with other vehicles. Our simulation showed that our traffic protocol is safer and more efficient than simple traffic protocols, while ensuring safety.

A significant problem of using deep learning techniques is the limited amount of data available for training. There are some datasets available for the popular problems like item recognition and classification for self-driving cars, however, it is very limited for the industrial robotics field. In previous work, we have trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image, but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots (UR). In this work, we extend our method to work with a new robot arm - Kuka LBR iiwa, which has a different appearance and an additional joint. However, instead of collecting large datasets once again, we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use Using the knowledge gained from training on one robot, we adapted the model to work with a new robot that looks and appears differently. We have proven that this approach requires smaller well-prepared training datasets, trains faster and reaches similar accuracy compared to the original method, even improving it on some aspects.

As for the humanoid robots the internal noise which is generated by motors fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy In this paper a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features For this we consider the bottleneck features which have been successfully applied to deep learning-based speech recognition system We first use the motor's on/off state to improve the initial sound modeling along with the sound features The second model then combines features from the first model and sound features When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate PER on TIMIT database the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement relative is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems

In this paper we present a transfer learning method for the end-to-end control of self-driving cars which enables a convolutional neural network CNN trained on a source domain to be utilized for the same task in a different target domain A conventional computer vision system is designed to turn a single camera image into a steering command To enable the transfer learning we let the CNN produce a steering command and a lane departure level using a new task module that receives data from the last layer The CNN trained on the source domain called source network is then utilized to train another task module called target network which also takes the output of the last convolutional layer of the source network and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain The steering commands from the source and target network are finally merged according to the LDL and the merged command is utilized for controlling a car in the target domain To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method we utilized two simulators TORCS and GTAV for the source and the target domains respectively Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of stable and safe control of cars
This paper describes the design implementation and successful use of the Bristol Stock Exchange BSE a novel minimal simulation of a centralised financial market based on a Limit Order Book LOB such as is common in major stock exchanges. Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the worlds major financial markets have automated with trading activity that previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by high-speed autonomous automated trading systems. Real-world exchanges dont allow researchers to test their ideas while the market is open so researchers have to work with past data instead. Similarly university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation automated trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experience in a sufficiently realistic teaching environment. BSE as described here addresses both those needs it has been successfully used for teaching and research in a leading UK university since 2012 and the BSE program code is freely available as open-source on GitHuB.
Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worry about it they will need to find new ways of entertainment \nThe simulation results show that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached in the areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04 and our approach can minimize delay \nHowever retrieving entertainment contents at the Data Center DC can hinder content delivery service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication \nTo address these challenges we propose a caching system for self-driving cars that uses advanced computer learning techniques \nFirst at DC a computer model is used to predict the contents that will be requested in specific areas \nTo reduce the car-DC delay the model's outputs are logged into roadside units \nSecond the car uses a special computer program to predict the age and gender of passengers so it can show them entertainment that's suited to their interests \nThrough this the self-driving car can identify the contents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached \nTo solve the problem a specialized algorithm is used to minimize delay
Moral responsibility is a concern in automated decision-making with applications from self-driving cars.
A key problem for autonomous car navigation is the understanding at an object level of the current driving situation. Addressing this issue requires the extraction of meaningful information from on-board stereo imagery by classifying the fundamental elements of urban scenes into semantic categories that can more easily be interpreted and be reflected upon streets buildings pedestrians vehicles signs etc. A new approach is presented to combine 3D map data with images from stereo cameras using a specific method called the Stixel framework. The proposed approach was tested on a manually labeled data set in urban environments. The results show that the classification accuracy of the fundamental elements composing the urban scene was significantly enhanced by this method compared to what is obtained from the semantic pixel-wise segmentation of a CNN alone.


Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars is important but neither industry nor authorities have settled on a standard way to test them Deploying self-driving cars for testing in regular traffic is a common but costly and risky method which has already caused fatalities It's hard to create enough tests for all possible driving situations with self-driving cars by doing them manually Therefore we developed AsFault a tool for automatically generating virtual tests for systematically testing self-driving car software We demonstrate AsFault by testing the lane keeping feature of an artificial intelligence-based self-driving car system for which AsFault generates scenarios that cause it to drive off the road A video illustrating AsFault in action is available at https://youtu.be/lJ1sa42VLDw
With the developing of the technology on self-driving, more and more L3 driverless vehicles are launched in market, people get opportunities to experience the self-driving cars in their daily life. As a result, there is a growing demand for the autopilot experience. Natural and efficient human-computer interaction can not only improve the driving experience, but also accelerate the process of self-driving commercialization. This paper explores three ways to interact with self-driving cars: eye movement, voice, and hand gestures. We examine the benefits and look at the future of human-computer interaction in self-driving vehicles.

At the brink of the introduction of self-driving vehicles only little is known about how potential users perceive them This is especially true for self-driving vehicles deployed in public transport services In this study the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus is assessed compared to a trip with a regular bus based on a survey to understand people's preferences for self-driving buses A statistical model was used to analyze people's preferences for self-driving buses based on how much they trust the technology and how interested they are in it The results show that currently public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus only for short trips This is due to the finding that the value of travel time is about twice as high for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus for a short commuting trip The public's preferences for automated public transport services will likely change as they become more familiar with the technology People who currently show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology perceive the self-driving busses better than others The popularity of self-driving busses decreases with the presence of a human steward on-board or if they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes
In the wake of the on-going digital revolution we will see a dramatic transformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions While the benefits of this transformation can be massive there are also tremendous risks to our society After society is becoming increasingly automated the automation of society is next We're at a crossroads we must choose between a society controlled from the top or one where decisions are made freely and together Modern information and communication systems ICT enable both but the latter has economic and strategic benefits Human dignity democratic decision-making and our democracies are under threat but they need to be protected
This paper addresses the financial markets problem space with particular emphasis on trading systems seen in banking today. Computing advancements now make it possible to execute international trades within milliseconds. We then move on and discuss the anatomy of a trading system and how it fits in with the banks' internal systems.

Many model based techniques have been proposed in the literature for applying domestic service tasks on humanoid robots, such as teleoperation, learning from demonstration and imitation. However, sensor based control overcomes many of the difficulties of uncertain models and unknown environments which limit the previous methods' limitations. Furthermore, for service and manipulation tasks, it is more suitable to study the interaction between the robot and its environment at the contact point using the sensor based control, rather than specifying the joint positions and velocities required to achieve them.
Inaccurate information is often considered a problem in the field of library and information science, and is often referred to as either misinformation or disinformation. Misinformation and disinformation, however, may cause significant problems for users in online environments, where they are constantly exposed to an abundance of inaccurate and/or misleading information. This paper aims to lay the foundation for future research by studying the connections between information, misinformation, and disinformation. Our analysis extends to a discussion of cues to deception, as means for detecting misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is more than just being inaccurate or incomplete, and not all disinformation is misinformation.

The importance of research on misinformation has received wide recognition. Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of theoretical models and the scarcity of misinformation in support of such research. This paper aims to address these challenges by understanding and making misinformation work better together. In particular, a representation and a model of misinformation are proposed through existing work in the field. The ontology-supported misinformation model can not only guide future misinformation research but also lay the foundation for building a digital misinformation library by advancing our knowledge on misinformation and by improving its sharing management and reuse. In addition we present a formal methodology for managing misinformation in a digital library and suggest future research directions related to the misinformation model.
Online Social Networks OSNs have become increasingly popular means of information sharing among users. The spread of news regarding emergency events is common in OSNs and so is the spread of misinformation related to the event. We define as misinformation any false or inaccurate information that is spread either intentionally or unintentionally. In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in OSNs and we focus in particular on the Twitter social network. We build a model to detect false information on Twitter by analyzing user and tweet characteristics and we use this model to identify suspicious patterns. Our approach is effective in identifying misinformation during emergencies. Furthermore our model manages to timely identify misinformation a feature that can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation.
The advent of WWW changed the way we can produce and access information Recent studies showed that users tend to select information that is consistent with their system of beliefs forming groups of people who share the same views around shared ideas In this environment users cooperate to frame and reinforce their shared narrative making any attempt at debunking inefficient Such a configuration occurs even in the consumption of news online and considering that 63% of users access news directly form social media one hypothesis is that more polarization allows for further spreading of misinformation Along this path we focus on the polarization of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European countries Italy France Spain and Germany First we compare the page posting behavior and how people interact with news in different countries and observe different posting liking and commenting rates Second we explore the tendency of users to interact with different pages i.e selective exposure and the emergence of polarized communities generated around specific pages People tend to group together with others who share their views and ignore opposing information
We find that Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain. Finally, we present a modified version of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence of these communities by considering engagement and trust on the news. Our findings suggest that trust in information broadcaster plays a pivotal role against polarization of users online.

Superintelligence is a potential type of future artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans in all major respects. If built, superintelligence could be a transformative event, with potential consequences that are beneficial or catastrophic. Meanwhile, the prospect of superintelligence is the subject of major ongoing debate, which includes a significant amount of misinformation. Superintelligence misinformation is potentially dangerous, ultimately leading bad decisions by the would-be developers of superintelligence and those who influence them. This paper surveys strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation. Two types of strategies are examined: strategies to prevent the spread of superintelligence misinformation and strategies to correct it after it has spread. Correcting misinformation is often hard, so preventing it in the first place is especially important. The strategies proposed can be applied to lay public attention to superintelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus.
The widespread online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages. The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed. Second, we show that it's difficult to efficiently solve the misinformation containment problem, meaning it's hard to quickly and accurately limit the spread of misinformation. Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks. Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging experimental results.
Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues provisional belief in conspiracy theories is—at the very—least understandable because conspiracies occur and if we take an evidential approach judging individual conspiracy theories on their particular merits belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases I examine the evidence related to conspiracy theories and find that the typical problems with this evidence are not exclusive to conspiracy theories As such if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorist’s use of evidence it is one of principle is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error I argue that whatever we might think about conspiracy theories generally there is no prima facie case for a scepticism of conspiracy theories based purely on their use of evidence
Conspiracy theories have gained much academic and media attention recently due to their large impact on public events However little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media We present a qualitative study of conspiracy theorizing on Reddit during a public health crisis the Zika virus outbreak Using a combination of content analysis and discourse analysis we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the Zika crisis the conditions under which Zika conspiracy theories emerge and the particular discursive strategies through which Zika conspiracy theories developed in online forums Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis reflecting their emergent information needs and their pervasive distrust in formal sources of Zika information Practical implications for social computing researchers health practitioners and policymakers are discussed
Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions whether to explain a late-breaking event that still lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent. Conspiracy theories spread quickly and become harder to track making it difficult to understand them and stop their spread. It is therefore crucial to develop methods to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities. What do users talk about when discussing conspiracy theories online. We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory the conspiratorial agents the actions they perform and their targets. For example a narrative-motif such as governmental agency-controls-communications represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements denote how governmental agencies control information. Thus narrative-motifs expose commonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances. In the process these representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about. Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.
Blockchain technology is the underlying enabling technology developed for Bitcoin the most common cryptocurrency. Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular with the potential to become a powerful disruptive force. Individuals and organizations may benefit from blockchain with its ability to make that transaction simpler and easier between entities. We create a model to understand why people accept cryptocurrencies based on how they think and behave. We offer empirical evidence for a better understanding of cryptocurrency adoption with practical implications in an e-government context.
With the introduction of memory-bound cryptocurrencies such as Monero the implementation of mining code in browser-based JavaScript has become a worthwhile alternative to dedicated mining rigs Based on this technology a new form of parasitic computing widely called cryptojacking or drive-by mining has gained momentum in the web A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies In this paper we systematically explore this phenomenon For this we propose a 3-step analysis approach that helps us discover mining scripts and examine the prevalence of cryptojacking on a large number of websites We find that cryptojacking is common with currently 1 out of 500 sites hosting a mining script Moreover we perform several secondary analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape including a measurement of code characteristics an estimate of how much money is made from mining and an evaluation of how well current countermeasures are working
The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance.  contracts :[39],"are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereumu0027s Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be vulnerable to hacking due to poor programming and tools. At the same time, smart contracts :[39],"are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential security vulnerabilities. We present Vandal, a tool to analyze and secure smart contracts on Ethereum. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level bytecode to semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the \souffle language.


For decentralised P2P networks, it is very important to have a mechanism in place that allows the nodes to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks with spam. In this paper, we discuss and compare the different methods used by cryptocurrency projects to control resources. The introduced methods are then applied to design a decentralised exchange for Namecoin names (or more generally, crypto assets) as an example.

Cryptocurrency was built initially as a possible implementation of digital currency then various derivatives were created in a variety of fields such as financial transactions capital management and even nonmonetary applications Our research found that cryptocurrency behaves similarly to stocks Our analysis shows that the cryptocurrency market is more fragile and higher-risk than the stock market
The smart device owning rate such as smart phone and smart watch is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become one of the major payment methods in many different areas. At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion. Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices. Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive. We propose two methods for cryptocurrency mobile payment: one that uses a bank and another that doesn't. We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.
Motivated by recent financial crises significant research efforts have been put into studying contagion effects and herding behaviour in financial markets. Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets. We introduce a new way to measure how similar financial news articles are on the web which we call the News Cohesiveness Index NCI. We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the interplay between financial markets and financially related news. We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the financial markets. Cohesiveness is more general and robust measure of systemic risk expressed in news than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms. Our results indicate that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly correlated with and driven by volatility on the financial markets.
In this paper I propose a methodology to study how different financial markets move together We analyze the stock market data from developed countries like France Germany the UK and the US to understand how they're connected I study how a shock in the US affects the other financial markets I also model the connection between the markets using a dynamic model
The use of mobile phone forensics to investigate fraudulent activity is nothing new. But mobile phones have evolved into smartphones, and fraudsters have evolved with them. Smartphones are packed with functionality that can easily be used for data theft or inappropriate contact with other parties - none of which passes through company-owned systems, and is to all intents and purposes 'off the grid'. Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued, along with ensuring that processes are in place when suspicions are raised, explains Philip Ridley of CCL-Forensics. Detecting corporate fraudsters requires a constant effort to stay ahead. It's not just about catching up with their knowledge, but also their use of technology. What's more, the methods through which they can manipulate technology to commit fraud are constantly evolving. This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or theft.
Phishers continue to alter the source code of the web pages used in their attacks to mimic changes to legitimate websites of spoofed organizations and to avoid detection by phishing countermeasures. Manipulations can be as subtle as source code changes or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. To appropriately respond to these changes to phishing campaigns a database of thousands of phishing attacks on many different brands is used employing a custom data set. The results of the experiments using a variety of different content-based approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate.

Detection of different types of image editing operations carried out on an image is an important problem in image forensics. It provides information about an image's history and can detect forgeries. There have been a few methods proposed to detect different types of image editing operations in a single framework. However, all the operations have to be known a priori in the training phase. But, in real-forensics scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based method which can differentiate between different types of image editing operations. The proposed method classifies image patches in a pair-wise fashion as either similarly or differently processed using a deep siamese neural network. Once the network learns feature that can discriminate between different image editing operations, it can differentiate between different image editing operations not present in the training stage. The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting/discriminating different image editing operations.


Image tampering, being readily facilitated and proliferated by today’s digital techniques, is increasingly causing problems regarding the authenticity of images. As the most popular multimedia data, JPEG images can be easily tampered without leaving any clues; therefore, JPEG-based forensics  has become an active research topic in multimedia forensics. Nevertheless, the interesting issue of detecting image tampering and its related operations by using the same quantization matrix has not been fully investigated. To detect tampered images, we propose a new method using a specific technique that rearranges the way images are compressed. Our experimental results indicate that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and relevant manipulations with the same quantization matrix.
In this paper we present a novel approach to accurately calibrate the kinematic model of a humanoid based on observations of its monocular camera. Our method estimates the camera's position and the robot's joints so it can see itself. Our technique also developed an approach to automatically select a subset of configurations for the calibration process that yields a good trade-off between the number of observations and accuracy. Further our approach to configuration selection yields substantially better optimization results compared to randomly chosen viable configurations. Hence our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results Our optimization is general and the implementation which is available online can easily be applied to different humanoids


In many situations users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed. Depending on the environment and the paths step-by-step following of the human might not be the optimal solution since better paths for the robot exist. We propose to perform a prediction about the human's future movements and use this information in a reinforcement learning framework to generate foresighted navigation actions for the robot. Since frequent occlusions of the human will occur due to obstacles and the robot's constrained field of view the estimate of the human's position and the prediction of their next destination can be uncertain. Our approach deals with such situations by explicitly considering occlusions in the reward function such that the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view. We show in simulated and real-world experiments that our technique leads to significantly shorter paths compared to an approach in which the robot always tries to closely follow the user and can handle occlusions.
An autonomous service robot often first has to search for a user to carry out a desired task. This is a difficult problem, especially when the person moves around because the robot can't see everything and the environment gets in the way. In this paper, we propose a novel method that computes the likelihood of the user’s observability at each possible location in the environment based on Monte Carlo simulations. As the robot needs time to reach the possible search locations, we take this time as well as the visibility constraints into account when computing effective search locations. In this way, the robot can choose the next search location that has the maximum expected observability of the user. Our experiments in various simulated environments demonstrate that our approach leads to a significantly shorter search time compared to a greedy approach with background information.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a 2D map is not enough because they can step over objects and need to know the height of their surroundings. Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning.
In this paper a lab automation drone notional concept is introduced Here a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to dexterously manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high throughput systems The resulting drone could augment existing HTS operations A 6-axis robotic arm and gripper design are presented Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given
Robot companionship has become more popular recently. However, humanoid gait might be somewhat unstable for these applications. Even with miniature humanoids, falls occur frequently. Thus, wheel attachments have been added onto a miniature humanoid, so it can move faster and with more stability than walking. In addition, with such attachments a robot can switch from walking to rolling when necessary. This paper explores how a small robot can fetch toys when commanded to do so.



The prevalence and rapid development of the Internet and mobile technology in recent decades has revamped our living styles and daily habits. To ride on the digital trend, more business activities have been engaged in the digital world. Marketing and advertising is one of typical business areas that is transformed digitally. The rise of social media and digital marketing platforms has attracted many businesses to consider using them for promoting their brands and products. with the increasing diversity of digital marketing tools, they must be carefully selected. In this paper, a method is proposed to help business practitioners choose the best digital marketing tools for their needs. The developed method streamlines the process of selecting digital marketing tools and helps practitioners achieve their marketing goals.
In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely the lack of direct evidence that muscle hypertrophy from exercise plays an important role in increasing strength. To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be primarily contingent on changes in muscle size. However, the idea that muscle size affects strength is surprisingly not well-supported by evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.
Low-intensity occlusion (50-100 mm hg) training provides a unique beneficial training mode for promoting muscle hypertrophy. Training at intensities as low as 20% 1 repetition maximum with moderate vascular occlusion results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as 3 weeks. A typical exercise prescription includes 3-5 sets with short breaks. The metabolic buildup causes a significant increase in growth hormone. Occlusion training is applicable for those who are unable to sustain high loads due to joint pain postoperative patients cardiac rehabilitation athletes who are unloading and astronauts.
Current dogma suggests aerobic exercise training has minimal effect on skeletal muscle size. We and others have found that regular aerobic exercise can increase muscle size. These findings promote a new way of thinking about skeletal muscle and provide insight into people who tend to lose muscle mass.
Stretch training is widely used in a variety of fitness-related capacities such as increasing joint range of motion, preventing muscle stiffness and alleviating injuries. Moreover, some researches indicate that stretch training may induce muscle hypertrophy; however, studies on the topic have been primarily relegated to animal and in vitro models. The purpose of this brief review was to evaluate whether stretch training is a viable strategy to induce muscle hypertrophy in humans. Of the 10 studies, 3 found that stretch training had a positive effect on muscle structure. In these studies, the stretching was aided by a machine or an external load. Of the 5 available studies that integrated stretching into a resistance training programme, 2 applied the stretching in the interset rest period and were the ones that showed enhanced muscle growth. In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to confer beneficial changes in muscle size and architecture; alternatively, albeit limited evidence suggests that when stretching is done with a certain degree of tensile strain (particularly when loaded, or added between active muscle contractions) may elicit muscle hypertrophy.
Cycle training is widely performed as a major part of any exercise program seeking to improve aerobic capacity and cardiovascular health. However, the effect of cycle training on muscle size and strength gain still requires further insight, even though it is known that professional cyclists display larger muscle size compared to controls. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycle training on muscle size and strength of the lower extremity and the possible mechanisms for increasing muscle size with cycle training. It is likely that cycle training takes a longer time to increase muscle size compared to typical weight training due to a slower growth rate. Cycle training appears to improve muscle size in both young and older adults equally, but older adults tend to see greater strength gains. For young adults, higher-intensity intermittent cycling may be required to achieve strength gains. It also appears that muscle hypertrophy induced by cycle training results from the positive changes in muscle protein net balance.

The effects of rest time between sets in weight training are unclear and need more research. Current evidence indicates that both short and long rest intervals may be useful for building muscle. New research shows that trained individuals may benefit from longer rest periods between sets to build muscle. However, more research is needed to fully understand the difference between short and long rest intervals.
Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. A new model based on existing research can explain how muscle memory works. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice.
It has been hypothesized that eating small frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance Several observational studies lend support to this hypothesis with an inverse relationship noted between the frequency of eating and adiposity This review looks at a study that analyzed how eating frequency affects fat and muscle mass Feeding frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and body fat percentage as well as an increase in fat-free mass However this raises questions about whether eating more often actually helps with weight loss since sensitivity analysis of the data showed that the positive findings were the product of a single study In conclusion although the initial results of this meta-analysis suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition these findings need to be interpreted with circumspection
Inactive adults experience a 3% to 8% loss of muscle mass per decade, accompanied by resting metabolic rate reduction and fat accumulation. Ten weeks of resistance training may increase lean weight by 1.4 kg, increase resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg. Benefits of resistance training include improved physical performance, movement control, walking speed, functional independence, cognitive abilities, and self-esteem. Resistance training may help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes by reducing fat and improving insulin sensitivity. Resistance training may enhance cardiovascular health, by reducing resting blood pressure, decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Resistance training may promote bone development, with studies showing 1% to 3% increase in bone mineral density. Resistance training may be effective for reducing low back pain and easing discomfort associated with arthritis and fibromyalgia and has been shown to reverse specific aging factors in skeletal muscle.
We hypothesized that compared to post-exercise protein intake, co-ingestion of alcohol would down-regulate the protein synthesis process and decrease rates of MPS.
Eight healthy physically active male subjects (age 21.4±4.8 yr, body mass (BM) 79.3±11.9 kg, peak oxygen uptake 48.1 mL/kg/min, leg extension one repetition maximum (1RM) 104±20 kg; values are mean ± SD) who had been participating in regular exercise (3 times wk−1 for >6 months) volunteered for this study.

Resistance exercise consisted of eight sets of five repetitions at 80% of maximum weight.
After completion of the final set, subjects rested for 5 min before commencing 30 min of continuous cycling at about 63% of their maximum physical effort (VO2 peak)
Upon completion, subjects rested on the bike for 2 min before undertaking 10×30 s high intensity intervals at about 110% of PPO, with 30 s active recovery about half of their maximum power output between each work bout.
Immediately following exercise and after 4 h recovery, subjects ingested a 500 mL solution of either protein 25 g whey protein powder a brand from Musashi in Melbourne or an energy-match in the form of CHO 25 g maltodextrin International Health Investments Helensvale QLD Australia
Furthermore, a CHO-based meal (1.5 grams per kilogram of body mass) was consumed ∼2 h post-exercise, immediately after the muscle biopsy, according to recommendations for post-exercise glycogen recovery [24].
This 8-hour period is crucial for post-exercise recovery and also the time when blood alcohol levels are likely to be high after a heavy drinking session as well as the period during which blood alcohol concentrations are likely to be elevated by a post-event drinking binge [1] as well as the period during which blood alcohol concentrations are likely to be elevated by a post-event drinking binge [14].
The alcohol ingestion protocol 1.5 grams of alcohol per kilogram of body weight 12 to 14 standard drinks began 1 h post-exercise and was consumed in 6 equal volumes of 1 part vodka ∼60 mL to four parts orange juice ∼240 mL during a 3 h period
The focus of the early post-exercise period (i.e., 1–8 h) is to enhance physiological processes that are critical for reversing the exercise-induced changes to the body's normal state and for promoting adaptations to training [1].
For the test condition, orange juice was consumed with a matched volume of water in place of the alcohol.
Subjects ingested the beverages within 5 minutes every 30 minutes.
Blood cell signaling and mRNA data were analyzed by statistical analysis of two variables (time and treatment) with repeated measures and myofibrillar protein synthesis was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with repeated measures

These outcomes were most evident when alcohol was consumed in the absence of post-exercise protein intake as is likely to occur when intoxication reduces the athlete's compliance to sound recovery practices. When drinking athletes are less likely to follow good recovery habits leading to a 37% drop in muscle protein synthesis.
However, a second finding was that even when protein is eaten after exercise, it works best when taken in certain amounts, drinking alcohol still reduces muscle growth by 24%, representing only a partial 'rescue' of the anabolic response compared with protein alone.
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central node for integrating nutrient (i.e. proteins) and exercise/contraction signal transduction [31], [32].
The current data provide that alcohol impairs the response of MPS in exercise recovery in human skeletal muscle.
The amount of alcohol consumed was based on how much was reported during drinking by athletes.
Reports suggest high intakes for some people, which is of concern for many reasons related to health and safety [13].

There is a lack of educational information about how alcohol affects sports performance. Regrettably there is a lack of educational information about how alcohol affects sports performance
Given the need to boost protein production that helps repair and grow muscle the results of the current study provide clear evidence of impaired recovery when alcohol is consumed after concurrent (resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity) exercise even in the presence of optimal nutritional conditions.
This data is interesting to athletes and coaches.
Our findings show that moderate drinking can help athletes recover and may change the way sports are managed.
Muscle contraction and eating leucine-rich protein activate independent but complimentary signaling responses that converge at the mechanistic target of rapamycin to stimulate protein translation enhancing rates of muscle protein synthesis [4]-[6]
The ingestion of 20-25 grams of high-quality protein after exercise, repeated every 4 hours has been shown to maximise the anabolic response in skeletal muscle.
The cultural environment surrounding some sports often involves the intake of large amounts of alcohol after training and competition, with athletes in several team sports being particularly at risk of excessive drinking practices [9]–[11].
Binge drinking after exercise is likely to include the effect of alcohol on the body and the impact on the athlete's recovery.

The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of alcohol intake on cell signaling and rates of muscle protein growth in humans during recovery from a bout of strenuous exercise approximating stresses an athlete may experience in training and performance for various team sports such as various football and rugby codes and court sports

Maximizing the hypertrophic response to resistance training (RT) is thought to be best achieved by proper manipulation of exercise program variables including exercise selection exercise order length of rest intervals intensity of maximal load and training volume An often overlooked variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration This refers to the total time of a repetition which depends on how fast you do the exercise We studied the effects of changing repetition duration on muscle growth Hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations between 0.5 and 8 seconds It appears that a wide range of repetition durations can be effective for muscle growth if thats the main goal Training very slowly may not be as effective for muscle growth due to a lack of conclusive research on the topic
Recovery from exercise refers to the time period between the end of a bout of exercise and the subsequent return to a resting or recovered state. It also refers to specific physiological processes or states occurring after exercise that are distinct from the physiology of either the exercising or the resting states. In this context recovery of the cardiovascular system after exercise occurs across a period of minutes to hours during which many characteristics of the system even how it is controlled change over time. Some changes after exercise help the body adapt while others can cause instability. Primary emphasis will be placed on how exercise affects blood pressure and the potential risks associated with it. Finally we focus on the practical application of this information to strategies to maximize the benefits of cardiovascular recovery or minimize the vulnerabilities of this state We will explore appropriate field measures and discuss to what extent these can guide an athlete's training
Exercise and physical activity are increasingly becoming key tools in the treatment and prevention of several medical conditions including arthritis and diabetes; this notion has been termed "exercise as medicine". Exercise has favorable effects on reducing cardiovascular risk, inflammation, cachexia, and hypertension, in addition to increasing physical functioning, strength, and cardio-respiratory capacity. Despite the varying stages of kidney disease, exercise can benefit all patients suffering from the condition. Chronic kidney disease, a condition that affects around 10% of the population, is often overlooked as a target for exercise-based therapy. In this review, we summarise the important role exercise may have in the clinical management of kidney disease and how this form of medicine should be best administered and prescribed.

In Japan, there were an estimated 43 million patients with hypertension in 2010. The management of this condition is given the highest priority in disease control, and the importance of lifestyle changes for the prevention and treatment of hypertension has been recognized in Japan. In particular, emphasis has been placed on increasing the levels of activities of daily living and physical exercise (sports). In this literature review, we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions (e.g., type, intensity, duration per session, and frequency) for the prevention and treatment of hypertension as described in Japanese and foreign articles. This review recommends safe and effective whole-body aerobic exercise at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-65% of maximum oxygen intake, 30-60 min per session, 3-4 times a week) that primarily focuses on the major muscle groups for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Resistance exercise should be low-intensity and not involve holding breath. It's only safe for those without chest symptoms.
Physical activity has proved to be an effective means of preventing several diseases and improving general health. Common sense advices call for late inception of intense, strength training-related activities, like weight lifting and plyometrics, which are usually postponed at the end of the growth age, even among sport practitioners. However, such advices seem to have a mainly anecdotal nature. Current research does not show any major concerns about strength training for children and adolescents, as long as they receive proper medical clearance and guidance from a qualified professional. At the same time, several studies provide consistent findings supporting the benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young subjects. Improved motor skills and body composition, in terms of increased fat free mass, reduced fat mass and enhanced bone health, have been extensively documented, especially if sport practice began early, when the subjects were pubescent. It can be therefore concluded that strength training is a relatively safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents.
recently there has been a renewed public interest in IFast Given the importance of nutrition in optimizing athletic performance there is a concern about the effects of IFast on athletics Studies have shown that fasting has no benefit for athletic performance in different types of exercises
Nearly every physically active person encounters periods in which the time available for exercise is limited e.g. personal family or business conflicts During such periods the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain rather than improve physical performance Similarly certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods namely athletes and military personnel In general populations endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33–66% as low as 13–26 minutes per session as long as the exercise intensity is maintained Strength and muscle size can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with minimal strength training as long as exercise intensity is maintained whereas in older populations maintaining muscle size may require more frequent and intense training Our primary conclusion is that exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time despite relatively large reductions in exercise frequency and volume
Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients--primarily protein and carbohydrate--in and around an exercise session. Some have claimed that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition. It has even been postulated that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients. The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing. Consuming the right mix of nutrients after exercise helps repair muscle damage and restore energy reserves. Several researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize training-related muscular adaptations. However, the importance of the post-exercise 'window' can vary depending on several factors. Not only is nutrient timing research open to question in terms of applicability, but recent evidence has directly challenged the classical view of the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake with respect to anabolism.
Lack of time is among the more commonly reported barriers for abstention from exercise programs. The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by critically evaluating research on acute training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral, multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise and one upper-body pulling exercise and one upper-body pushing exercise. Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability, and personal preferences. Weekly training volume is more important than how often you train. We recommend doing at least 4 sets per muscle group each week, with a load that's heavy enough to challenge you but not so heavy that you can only do 4-15 repetitions. Advanced training techniques, such as supersets, drop sets and rest-pause training roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects. Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.
Training frequency is considered an important variable in the hypertrophic response to regimented resistance exercise. This study looked at how different training frequencies affect muscle growth and reviewed the results of various experiments. Results showed no significant difference between higher and lower frequency on a volume-equated basis. Higher frequency training showed some benefits over lower frequency training, but the difference was relatively small. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not significantly or meaningfully impact muscle hypertrophy when volume is equated. Thus, for a given training volume individuals can choose a weekly frequency per muscle groups based on personal preference.
Several training techniques are used to increase muscle growth. Forced repetitions/drop sets, supersets, and heavy negatives, in particular, have been purported to enhance the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise. This article will explore the potential role of these techniques in promoting muscle hypertrophy and provide an insight into possible applications to resistance training programs.
