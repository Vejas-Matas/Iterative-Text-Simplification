In the modern era of robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in various activities in the commercial and civilian sectors, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to government rules for drone flying, tracking roads is garnering interest.
we propose a computer-based solution to autonomous drone navigation for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system performs better. It uses AI.
The data used for training the system was taken by the drone, in city streets, by professional pilots.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process.
With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6 meters per second.
We present the same results in this research and compare them with current best methods of vision and navigation.
Recognizing Traffic Signs with computers can drastically reduce the number of accidents happening world-wide.
It's a problem to read traffic signs.
Various machine learning models like Random Forest and deep learning have been proposed for traffic sign classification.
Though they reach best performance on a particular data-set, but fall short of tackling multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks.
In this paper, we propose a novel and all-purpose architecture that performs well on multiple tests with better overall score than the state-of-the-art architectures.
Our model is made of residual blocks with hierarchical dilated skip connections joined in steps.
With this we score 99.33% accuracy in German sign recognition and 99.17% accuracy in Belgian traffic sign classification benchmark.
