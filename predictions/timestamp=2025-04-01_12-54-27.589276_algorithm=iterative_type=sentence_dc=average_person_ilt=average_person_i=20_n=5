In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are being researched by both academics and industries.
With the ever increasing number of drones being used in both civilian and commercial settings, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning based solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by copying a good pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep neural network, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
