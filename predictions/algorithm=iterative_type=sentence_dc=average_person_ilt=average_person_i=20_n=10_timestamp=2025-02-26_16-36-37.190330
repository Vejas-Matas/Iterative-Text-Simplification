In the modern age of automation autonomous vehicles are currently a focus of research.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones Navigation is popular
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using specialized images of the input frames.
Based on a specific computer model, our system performs better in terms of performance and quality than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in urban areas, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from the authorities to minimize the risk to pedestrians during data collection.
We collected a lot of data from our drones, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
The efficiency of the drone's system enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6 meters per second.
