In the modern era of automation and robotics, cars are being tested.
With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in both civilian and commercial use, for autonomy.
Due to governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, The score is 5.6, navigation is garnering interest.
Learn to fly a drone like an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system performs better in terms of accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning. It's a machine.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, in different locations, by experienced pilots.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process. The passage has a high FKGL score, indicating it's complex.
We have been able to navigate roads safely.
The drone can fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.
