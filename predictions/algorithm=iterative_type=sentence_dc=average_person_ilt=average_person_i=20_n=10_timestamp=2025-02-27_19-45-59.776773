In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are being researched by both academics and industries.
Drones used in both personal and business settings, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a computer-based learning method to driving by learning to fly by copying a skilled pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been built using a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning using a New architecture.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around city streets, by experts with extensive flying experience.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who ensured that pedestrian safety was a priority during data collection process.
With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate safely through roads, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.
