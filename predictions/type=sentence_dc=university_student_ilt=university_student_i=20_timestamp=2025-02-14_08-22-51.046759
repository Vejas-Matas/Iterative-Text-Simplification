autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research
There is an increased need for autonomy in unmanned aerial vehicles.
Due to rules set by the government for drone usage, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a learning from data approach to UAV autonomy for driving through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from traditional image classification methods, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep neural network that evaluates the presence of roads using computer-generated images.
Based on the Modified Inception, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts with significant flying experience.
Permissions were taken from authorities who made sure that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process.
With a large amount of data from drones, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%
MAVNet allows the drone to fly quickly up to 6 meters per second.
We compare our results with other navigation methods.
Recognizing traffic signs reduces accidents.
With the arrival of Self-driving cars it has become a staple challenge to solve the recognition of traffic signs.
Machine learning techniques like Random Forest and deep learning models has been proposed for classifying traffic signs.
Though they reach current state-of-the-art performance on a particular data-set, but fall short of tackling multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks.
In this paper we propose a novel and unified architecture that performs well on various tests with better overall score than the state-of-the-art architectures.
Our model is made of convolutional blocks with hierarchical dilated skip connections joined in steps.
With this we score 99.33% Accuracy in German sign recognition and 99.17% accuracy in Belgian traffic signs
Moreover we propose a newly devised residual learning technique which is very low in both memory and computation
We introduce Ignition: a neural network system for training self-driving vehicles in simulated environments.
The model is a ResNet-18 variant, which is fed in images from a simulated racing car, and outputs optimal labels for steering, throttle, braking.
we never explicitly train the model to detect road features like the outline of a track or distance to other cars; we show that these features can be automatically learned by the network
In this paper we present a transfer learning method for the complete control of self-driving cars which enables a specialized computer vision network trained on a source domain to be utilized for the same task in a different target domain
