The nurses found that the system increased prevention and safety and was useful and user-friendly.
access to patient appointment schedules can help clinicians manage time and problems better. Many healthcare organizations use a special computer system to manage appointments but it's hard for doctors to access this information. Also staff other than the clinician's personal assistant may manage scheduling making it difficult for clinicians to stay informed of changes. Many a clinician today uses a personal digital assistant containing basic calendaring functionality Our “PalmOversite” project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating appointment schedule information into a PDA calendar making schedule information much more readily available to the clinician
We describe the development and implementation of a personal digital assistant (PDA) based electronic system to collect and upload monthly bacteriology data into the PIH-EMR. A pilot study was conducted to test the use of this system. The system was implemented in one health district while another district continued to use the paper-based system. The PDA-based system reduced the time it took to process data from 54.8 days to 6.2 days. It also reduced the number of errors from 10.1% to 2.8%. Users gave positive feedback about the system. The system will be studied further to see how it can improve delays, errors, and costs.

In recent years we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking. These applications have been written for the Cybiko personal digital assistant an inexpensive alternative to other hardware. Unfortunately the Cybiko PDA was recently discontinued. As a result these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful. Instead of porting each application to individual platforms we created the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer helps Cybiko apps work on other platforms with little code change.
Unlike many other classes of hardware, smartcards do not have the ability to communicate securely with the user. They are difficult to utilize because the owner is not informed. We explore the area where smartcards meet other  more powerful machines. A personal digital assistant is an extension of the user's private sphere. It must have enough functionality to create trustworthy digital signatures to speak for the user. A smartcard can act as a memory aid, helping the owner remember addresses and phone numbers. Smartcards are designed to be tamper resistant. However, they cannot create trustworthy digital signatures alone. A smartcard must be supported by some infrastructure outside the card. We demonstrate that trustworthy digital signatures can be made using a standard. Nontrivial systems can be constructed by utilizing smartcards. Smartcards are here to stay, finding ways to apply them is prudent.

The design was a trial conducted in a resident clinic. Internal medicine residents received a tool for their work. Unannounced patients presented to the doctors. Safety was checked from the prescriptions given to the patients. Each prescription was reviewed by a group of doctors.\n\nPrescriptions were judged as safe or unsafe. After the intervention, the people who used the tool made fewer mistakes with prescriptions compared to those who didn't. The main outcome was how safe the doctors were with their prescriptions. At the start, the two groups were similar. People who used the tool made fewer mistakes than those who didn't.
Recently pedestrian navigation has been studied by many researchers which provides pedestrians with a similar function of car navigation. On the other hand a 3dimensional map has been utilized as a simulation tool in city and landscape planning and other engineering fields. The 3D maps will give more intuitive information compared to conventional 2-dimensional ones. In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on 3D maps and describe technologies required and its use situations. Secondly we compare effectiveness of D and 3D maps for navigation by object search experiments under conditions 3D maps with and without texture display sizes on a phone and a handheld device. The experimental results show that 3D maps with texture on mobile phone display size and 3D maps without texture on PDA display size are superior to 2D maps in search time and error rate. From these results we can say the effectiveness of 3D maps in pedestrian navigation.

We use mobile phones and digital assistants to access the Web. We also created a system that changes Web content into a format that's easy to view on mobile devices. We implemented a system that transforms Web content into a format that's useful for mobile terminals. The presentation of Web content depends on the terminal type. Mobile and desktop terminals have some differences in device characteristics that affect the presentation. When changing the access style, the presentation should be adjusted for the terminal type. We developed a method for visual presentation. We represent the emotional aspect of a Web page by adjusting the background color of the screen. We emphasize the subject of the content by its main word. We segment the picture of the content into pieces and present one after another. These procedures can be applied to any type of terminal.

A truly personal machine called a private machine and implemented as a Personal Digital Assistant is fundamentally different from traditional machines. It is very private and unique in a way that network and power failures will not be rare. Designing systems where PDAs are treated as first class citizens is a private : assets will be stored in PDAs. Ownership and control of these assets and the media that store and communicate them should remain with the user. This must be reflected in the design of systems for private We use a design approach that helps systems show users information rather than hide it. This way users can make better decisions about their data and control their system. The system we have designed and implemented under this design approach is presented and discussed.

This paper presents a method to generate pseudonyms in a personal environment. Each user can generate his pseudonym locally in his own security environment. There is no need for any information interchange between parties, except for unique identifiers for each user and device. The holder can prove he generated a specific pseudonym without revealing his identity. He can also reveal his identity by disclosing the pseudonym. The verifier can be sure the presenter of the pseudonym is the holder of the pseudonym. The user's and device identifiers are used to generate unique pseudonyms, and they are stored in encrypted form.
Mobile devices are used for location-based services such as city maps, route planning, and traffic information. These devices do not have as much power or storage as a computer or laptop. To solve this problem, a route computation for public transport was developed for a digital assistant. Breaking down the route computation process into smaller steps helps to save power on the device.

As extensive research has shown individuals suffer from diverse biases in decision-making. In our paper we analyze the effects of decision-making biases of managers on organizational performance. In the simulations managers made decisions based on different company structures and pay systems and these decisions were influenced by biases in decision-making. The results show how biases interact and affect company performance in various situations Surprisingly some combinations of biases actually improve performance but each bias on its own can be a problem
Big data delivers immense benefits in marketing, healthcare, and more. The current privacy framework is strained by big data. As we interact with artificial agents, it raises legal and philosophical questions. The machine may exacerbate or draw attention to ethical challenges, but humans must be held accountable. Policymakers should devise guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling.
Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups. We conducted a study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 people to understand how they interact with it. The study found that native English speakers had a better user experience than non-native English speakers. This suggests that language skills are important for interacting with devices like this.
the smart speakers cannot distinguish human voice from machine voice\na way to tell if a person or machine is controlling the smart speaker is needed\nto prevent fake voice commands when no one is home we propose a system to detect a human nearby using a speaker and microphone
As smart speakers become more common people will get used to talking to them. Sometimes they make mistakes like not understanding what you said or not playing the music you asked for. This can be frustrating. When this happens it's important for the speaker to give a good response. Different companies have different ways of doing this. We looked at what people prefer. We found that people are happier and think the speaker is more sincere when it apologizes. When the speaker can't play music, humor doesn't make a difference. But when the speaker can't understand, being funny makes things worse.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to compare different types of compounds. Significant differences were found between drug molecules and compounds in screening libraries. This could help improve the success of new drug discovery projects.
