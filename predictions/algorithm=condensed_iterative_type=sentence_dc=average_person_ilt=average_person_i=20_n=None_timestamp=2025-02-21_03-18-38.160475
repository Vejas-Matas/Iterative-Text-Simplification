In the modern era of automation, autonomous vehicles are the focus of research.
With more drones being used in civilian and commercial activities, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to government rules for drones, drone navigation is getting attention
We propose a solution that lets a drone learn to fly like an expert by observing how they do it and it should be able to drive through city streets.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms our classifier has been constructed in the form of a special computer model that looks for roads in images
Our system performs better than many existing models
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone by flying it in urban areas by experts with a lot of flying experience.
Permission was taken from the right authorities who made sure that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process.
We have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting.
A system enables the drone to fly fast The drone flies fast
We present the same results in this research and compare them with other methods of navigation.
Recognizing Traffic Signs can reduce accidents.
It has become a challenge to recognize traffic signs in the streets.
Various machine learning techniques like Random Forest and deep learning models have been proposed for classifying traffic signs.
They perform well on a particular data-set, but struggle with multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks.
This paper proposes a new architecture that does better than other top architectures.
Our model is made of blocks with skip connections joined in steps.
We scored very high accuracy in both German and Belgian sign recognition benchmarks.
we propose a new technique that is very low in both memory and computational complexity
We introduce Ignition a special computer system for training self-driving cars in virtual worlds
The model is a special type of neural network that is trained on images from a virtual F1 car, and gives the best directions for steering, acceleration, and braking.
we illustrate that these features can be automatically detected by the network
we present a way to use a trained model to control a self-driving car even if it was trained on a different place like a special kind of AI that uses a special kind of image recognition to make decisions for cars on the road
A CNN maps a camera image to a steering command
To help the model learn from existing knowledge we modified it to also predict whether the car is leaving its lane.
A network is trained on a source domain. It is then used to train another task module for a target domain. This module takes the output of the last layer of the source network and produces a steering command for the target domain.
The steering commands from the source and target network are merged and used to control a car.
We used two simulators TORCS and GTAV to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for both the source and target domains.
The proposed method outperforms other methods in controlling cars.
A significant problem of using deep learning is the limited amount of data available for training.
There aren't many datasets for robots and their tasks especially for factories recognizing objects in cars
In previous work we have trained a multi-objective Convolutional Neural Network that can identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots
we extend our method to work with a new robot arm Kuka LBR iiwa
However instead of collecting large datasets once again we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use a special method to adapt the trained model to a new robot having different shapes and visual features.
transfer learning is a process that uses existing knowledge to learn new things quickly and it requires smaller training datasets trains quickly and reaches similar accuracy to the original method even improving it on some aspects
People are concerned about making good choices when machines make decisions such as in self-driving cars or organ swaps

We cast a system within a closed network model.
A real-time rebalancing algorithm is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed.
The case study of New York shows that the taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles roughly the size of the current taxi fleet.
We study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on traffic.
This paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of coordinating autonomously driving vehicles and shows the benefits of robotic transportation.
Because of the digital revolution, we will see a dramatic transformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions.
While the benefits can be massive, there are also risks to our society.
The automation of many production processes and the creation of self-driving vehicles is next.
This is a crossroads between a society where actions are decided by others and implemented by coercion or technology and a society where decisions are made freely and together.
Information systems enable both, but the latter has economic and strategic benefits.
lived societies but also the basis of greater efficiency and success
When cars become self-driving and people are no longer worried, they will need to find new ways of entertainment.
However getting content from a central server can slow down streaming due to a slow connection
To address these challenges we propose using a specialized computer system for cars using a computer system on the car's edge computer.
First at a special kind of computer model is used to predict what people will ask for in different areas.
To reduce the car delay roadside units are used.
A special computer model is used to guess the age and gender of the passengers.
Through this the self-driving car can identify what needs to be downloaded.
Finally we formulate specialized computer technology in a car that enhances entertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize content downloading delay.
To solve the problem a technique is applied.
The simulation results show that our method is achieved at 98.04% and our approach can minimize delay in the car's system
This paper describes the Bristol Stock Exchange, a simulation of a centralised financial market, based on a Limit Order Book.
Most of the world's major financial markets have automated with trading now being performed by computers.
Researchers have a hard time understanding how this new financial market works. This is because no real-world exchange allows experiments while it is open. They have to work with past data instead.
Engineers need hands-on experience in a realistic teaching environment to create new trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experience in a realistic teaching environment.
BSE has been used for teaching and research in a UK university since 2012 and its code is open-source on GitHub
We studied the study of how stock prices react to financial news.
Thereby, we specifically shed light into the extensive amount of filings for which no categorization of their content is not clear.
we use a method called latent Dirichlet allocation to identify topics
This technique facilitates our task of automatically categorizing the content of over 70,000 company filings from U.S. companies.
We then check the stock market reaction.
Our research shows that different news stories have varying effects on the stock market.
We find an abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating, as well as for business strategy and health information.
Our results yield findings that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating how filings should be structured and the topics most likely to precede changes in stock valuations.
This paper addresses the financial markets with a focus on trading systems in banking today.
Trading transactions can now be executed quickly thanks to software systems technology.

humanoid robots suffer from internal noise generated by their movements which degrades their speech recognition
A new speech recognition system is proposed for robots. It uses the motor's on and off state as extra help to find the right sounds.
For this, we consider features that have been successfully applied to speech recognition systems.

the second DNN employs both the bottleneck features and the acoustic features
Our method shows an improvement of 11% over other systems.
Various techniques have been proposed in the literature for applying domestic service tasks on humanoid robots such as teleoperation learning from demonstration and imitation
Sensor based robot control helps in uncertain environments.
It is more suitable to study the interaction between the robot and its environment at the contact point using sensors, rather than specifying the positions and velocities needed to achieve tasks.
Users can engage with opinions on social media.
Simultaneously they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to choose what they want to see through both personal preferences and online news feeds
A basic understanding of such trade-offs is still missing.
We introduce a social learning model where most people in a network update their beliefs based on new information, but some people have a bias that enables them to reject news that are against their existing beliefs.
We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can lead to strong opposing views.
unbiased agents seem biased because of their neighbours' influence

Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by keeping different ideas around.
However results also indicate that when people become too biased they start making mistakes because they dont consider different opinions accuracy declines because biased people dont consider different opinions
We discuss the policy implications of our model, highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.
The advent of the web changed the way we can produce and access information.
Users tend to select information that is consistent with their own beliefs \nforming groups of people with similar views where opposing information is ignored
In this environment users work together to agree on a shared story trying to prove it wrong
Most people get news from social media and this can spread false information Considering that 63% of users access news directly from social media one hypothesis is that more polarization allows for further spreading of misinformation
Along this path people's opinions on news in different European countries (Italy, France, Spain and Germany) are often divided.
First we compare the page posting behavior and the users interacting patterns across countries and observe different posting liking and commenting rates
We explore the tendency of users to interact with different pages and polarized communities formed around specific topics.
Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and Spain.
we present a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence of these communities by considering users' engagement and trust on the news
Our findings suggest that trust in the news plays a pivotal role against polarization of users in general.
For Decentralized peer-to-peer networks, it is very important to have a mechanism in place that allows the nodes to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks with spam.
We discuss and compare different approaches used by cryptocurrency projects.
The introduced methods are then applied to design an exchange for digital currency as an example.
With the introduction of special types of cryptocurrencies like Monero can now be mined using a browser the implementation of mining code in a browser has become a worthwhile alternative to dedicated mining rigs.
cryptojacking has gained momentum in the web \nA cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies
In this paper we systematically explore this phenomenon For this we propose a three-step analysis method which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in the Alexa 1 million websites
We find that cryptojacking is common, with 1 in 500 websites are hacked for mining.
we perform to better understand the way cryptojacking works including an analysis of the code and its potential earnings and a look at how blacklists are being used to prevent it
The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts that run on the blockchain.
Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence with applications predicted in law business commerce and governance contracts are written in a high-level language like Solidity and then put on the blockchain
Once deployed the bytecode is executed by a virtual machine.
As with all programs smart contracts can be vulnerable to attacks due to poor programming and tools

As Bitcoins popularity has grown over the decade since its creation it has become an increasingly attractive target for adversaries
Image tampering is causing problems regarding the authenticity of images.
JPEG images can be easily tampered with therefore detecting tampering techniques has become a major area of research focusing on detecting tampering
the problem of detecting image tampering and its related operations by using the same quantization matrix has not been fully solved
Aiming to detect forgeries we propose a detection method by using a special technique to detect changes
classifiers are applied for classification
This method is effective in detecting image tampering Our results show that this method is effective in detecting image tampering
The alteration of time is a big challenge in forensics.
Detecting such changes is of great importance.
However, this can be difficult since the attacker has many opportunities to hide such changes.
In particular, cloud computing, the time of both the host and guest machines can be manipulated in various ways by an attacker.
Guest virtual machines are vulnerable to attacks from their host.
Ensure that timeline changes in the cloud are detectable.
We survey the issues related to cloud security.
We describe a new way to detect and correct problems with hosts and guests.
The framework has been implemented on a simulator.
Performance figures show the feasibility of our proposal.
Detecting image edits is an important problem in image forensics.
It gives the information about the history of the image and can expose forgeries present in an image.
There have been a few methods proposed to detect image editing operations in a single framework.
all the operations have to be known in the training phase
It may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image
We propose a new method that can tell apart different image editing operations.
The proposed method classifies image patches as either similarly or differently processed using a neural network.
Once the network learns a feature that can recognize different image editing operations it can recognize new image editing operations.
The experimental results show the efficacy of the method in detecting different image editing operations.

Research has shown individuals suffer from diverse biases in decision-making.
In our paper we analyze the impact of biases of managers in team decisions on organizational performance.
Decision-making suffers from biases due to complex systems and incentives. This is due to standard decision-making theories.
The results illustrate how biases affect organizational performance.
We find that some combinations of biases can actually help but individual biases can hurt
This might evoke considerations about decision-making being rational.
Navigation in dynamic environments requires a robot's ability to sense its surroundings.
Most robots rely on planar regions.
humanoids can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information
Obstacles can cause problems that need to be addressed later.
In this paper we present a framework that first looks for flat areas and detects dynamic obstacles.
Our system uses this information to create maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low cost.
We tested in both simulations and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for 3D footstep planning.
A robot often first has to search for a user to carry out a task.
This is a challenging problem. The robot's field of view is constrained and the environment poses visibility constraints.
We propose a new way to figure out how visible a user is in different locations in the environment.
As the robot needs time to reach the search locations We consider the time it takes and visibility when planning the search.
the robot can choose the next search location that has the best view of the user
Our experiments in various test environments demonstrate that our approach leads to a shorter search time compared to a greedy approach with background information.
Users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed.
The robot might not follow human instructions because it can find a better path.
We propose to perform a prediction about the human's future movements and use it to help the robot make good decisions about its movements.
Since the human will often be hidden from view, the estimate of the human's position is uncertain.
Our approach accounts for obstacles in the system so it can move to see the human.
Our technique leads to shorter paths than following the user closely and handling occlusions which we tested in simulated and real-world experiments
We introduce an approach to robot navigation through cluttered environments.
We propose to use detected objects to predict costs of obstacles in areas the robot can't see.
By taking into account the predicted costs the robot is then able to navigate in a more foresighted manner and reduces the risk of getting stuck in cluttered regions.
Our method enables the robot to navigate through cluttered areas and achieves shorter completion times compared to a standard approach.
We present a navigation system that allows humanoid robots to navigate in cluttered environments.
From the data of a regular depth camera our system estimates the robot's pose to compensate for drift and maintains a map of the area
Based on this model our system computes safe movements including walking and body movements leading the robot to target locations
we developed a new approach to check for collisions during movements
Our system leads to navigation in cluttered environments and the robot is able to traverse challenging passages.
We present a new way to accurately calibrate a humanoid based on its single camera.
Our technique estimates the parameters of the model, including camera angles and camera settings.
We developed an approach to select a subset of configurations for the calibration process that yields a good trade-off between observations and accuracy.
Our approach to choosing the best configuration works much better and gives better results than random choices.
Our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results.
Our optimization can be applied to different humanoids.

Big data delivers immense benefits in marketing efficiency, healthcare, environmental protection, national security and more.
The current privacy rules are having trouble keeping up with the new big data world.
As we interact with artificial agents in settings with no human mediator, their autonomy raises legal and philosophical questions.
The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding data driven ethical dilemmas such as privacy fairness and discrimination.
The machine may exacerbate or enable the ethical challenges but it is humans who must be held responsible
Policymakers should seek to devise guidelines for fair data use and analysis and profiling.
Such guidelines would address the use of data obfuscation; criteria for unethical behavior; privacy harms; and empowering individuals through data access.
people will get used to voice interaction
Speech recognition and language processing have improved a lot in recent years users still may encounter errors from time to time which can frustrate users
When an error message is reported it is vital that the smart speaker gives a proper response.
speaker brands in China differed on two things apology or humor
user's preference of response strategies
Two variables were measured: satisfaction and how sincere the response was.
People were more happy when the smart speaker apologized in both mistakes.
humor had no impact on the perception of satisfaction and sincerity
humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity
smart speakers cannot tell human voices from other voices
We need to decide between human and machine voice commands to a smart speaker.
to prevent fake voices from tricking the speaker when no one is home we propose a system to detect people nearby using a speaker and microphone This could be added to smart speakers in the future
Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing voice assistants support limited language options.
we conducted a study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 people to see how they use it
The findings show that native English speakers had better user experiences in interacting with the device.
It also shows that users language skills are important for using voice interfaces.
The findings from this study can create insights for developers to improve voice recognition in various languages making voice recognition work for people who speak different languages.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process specifically drug molecules and nondrug molecules
Significant differences were observed between the drug molecules and the high-throughput screening compounds.
It is suggested that pharmacophore analysis can help find better compounds for new drugs optimizing the selection of compounds and designing libraries can improve the odds of success in drug discovery.

A key problem for autonomous car navigation is understanding the current driving situation.
Addressing this issue requires the extraction of meaningful information from live images from the vehicle by classifying the fundamental elements of urban scenes into categories that can be easily understood streets buildings pedestrians vehicles signs etc
A new way is proposed to combine 3D map data with images from stereo vision using a special computer algorithm
A novel fusion architecture based on the Stixel framework is presented for combining image analysis from a convolutional neural network with depth information obtained from stereo imagery while integrating coarse prior depth and label information
The proposed approach was tested on a data set in urban environments.
The results show that the classification accuracy of the urban scene was improved by this method compared to a CNN alone.
In recent years self-driving vehicles have become more commonplace on public roads with the goal of making transportation safer.
Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on highfidelity simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle.
It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that driverless cars are tested in many difficult virtual driving situations.
The current methods in driving scenario generation as used by leading companies in self-driving cars still relies on human input [1]
In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose self-driving policies that aren't working well, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.
We show that by incorporating generated scenarios into the training set of the self-driving policy, and by fine-tuning the policy we obtain safer self-driving behavior.
self-driving cars are launched in the market, people get opportunities to experience self-driving cars in their daily life
there is a growing demand for the autopilot experience
Good human-machine interaction can not only improve the driving experience but also accelerate the process of self-driving cars becoming commercial
This paper discusses how people interact with self-driving cars and looks at how it works its good and bad points and looks at what the future might hold for self-driving cars and how people will interact with them
Self-driving vehicles are expected to be important in the future of transportation.
One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation among multiple vehicles.
When self-driving vehicles occupy the same space they might collide with each other become stuck or stop suddenly making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers.
In this paper we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points
We present a safe protocol for merge points where self-driving vehicles use their own perception systems to cooperate with other vehicles.
Our results show that our traffic protocol is better and safer.
Self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles.
These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via networks.
Self-driving vehicles face new threats.

A vehicle detector for identifying malicious vehicles in cars that drive themselves or are partially automated.
This paper proposes a MATLAB Simulink benchmark suite for an open-source self-driving system based on ROS.
One approach to the development of self-driving cars is the utilization of ROS which helps with the development of robot applications.
On the other hand the popular approach in the automotive industry is the utilization of MATLAB/Simulink which is specialized computer software
MATLAB/Simulink provides an interface between ROS and MATLAB/Simulink making it easy to build ROS robots in MATLAB/Simulink
It has not been fully utilized in the development of driverless cars yet because there are not enough samples and it is hard for developers to adopt this technology.
we provide a benchmark suite for a self-driving system called Autoware
Autoware is a self-driving software that provides a set of self-driving modules.
The provided benchmark contains samples available in Autoware
They help to design self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink.
Self-driving cars need to be safe. There is no standard way to test them.
Testing self-driving cars in regular traffic is a costly and risky method, which has already caused fatalities.
As a safer alternative virtual tests have been proposed.
It's impossible to test all possible driving situations for self-driving cars manually
We created a tool called AsFault to test car software. It creates tests for self-driving cars.

People are not sure how they will react to self-driving vehicles.
This is especially true for self-driving vehicles.
In this study the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus is assessed compared to a trip with a regular bus based on a survey where people express their preferences
Based on the responses of 282 respondents from the Netherlands and Germany a model is estimated including attitudes towards self-driving vehicles and interest in technology.
Passengers prefer the self-driving bus for short trips.
self-driving buses take about twice as long as regular buses for short trips
Findings from this study further suggest that self-driving busses do not work well with a human on board or when they follow fixed routes.
People who show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology perceive the busses better than others.
Automated public transport services are expected to become more popular as they move to regular use.
The management of self-driving systems is becoming more complex as self-driving technology progresses.
The use of Simulink can simulate and evaluate the models used for self-driving.
These models are incompatible
It is necessary to rewrite the C++ code and incorporate them into the system, which makes development hard.
Therefore the proposed framework allows models created using MATLAB to be used in a self-driving system thereby improving development efficiency.
our evaluations demonstrated its practical potential
Online Social Networks have become increasingly popular means of information sharing among users.
The spread of news regarding emergency events is common in social networks and so is the spread of misinformation related to the event.
We define as misinformation any wrong information that is spread either intentionally or unintentionally.
We study the problem of misinformation in social networks and focus on Twitter.
Based on user and tweets characteristics we build a model that detects suspicious behavior and false information.
Our results on a large number of tweets and users show that our method works well during emergencies.
Our model can limit the spread of misinformation.

Superintelligence misinformation is potentially dangerous ultimately leading bad decisions by those who create or influence superintelligence
This paper surveys strategies to counter fake news.
Ways to stop fake misinformation and strategies to correct it after it has spread
In general misinformation can be difficult to correct suggesting a way to prevent it.
The strategies proposed can be applied to raise public awareness and build consensus.
The widespread false information online could cause public panic and serious economic damages.
trying to stop false information from spreading online
We present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem.
First, we provide a formal model for multi-level diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority.
Misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a certain factor in polynomial time unless a certain complexity class.
We introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks.
We design novel algorithms for solving the problem.
The proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging results.
Inaccurate information in the library and information science is often regarded as a problem that needs to be corrected or simply understood as false information without further consideration.
However false information can cause problems for users in where they are exposed to false information an abundance of inaccurate and or misleading information
This paper sets the foundation for future research It studies the relationships between information and false information
Our analysis extends to a discussion of signs of lying as a way to detect false information.
They are related but different kinds of false information.
Misinformation is inaccurate or incomplete information.
Social media has both benefits and drawbacks but it also spreads false information
The wide spread of misinformation is injurious to public interest.
We design a framework to help identify misinformation.
Determine a user's expertise from what they write online; and match the experts with given suspected misinformation
sending the suspected misinformation to experts can help refute it
we focus on expert finding for misinformation
We propose a method to track the skills of social media users with tags.
Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for expert finding with respect to identifying false information on social media.
Research has received wide recognition.
Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of models and misinformation about the research.

we present a way to manage misinformation online and suggest future research directions related to the misinformation model
Conspiracy theories have gained much attention recently due to their impact on public events.
Little is known about conspiracy theories on social media.
We present a study of conspiracy theories on Reddit during the Zika virus outbreak.
We used a combination of different methods to analyze the data we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the Zika crisis how Zika conspiracy theories started and the particular ways through which Zika conspiracy theories developed in online forums
Conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis reflecting their distrust in formal sources of Zika information and information needs that are changing rapidly
Practical implications for the average person are discussed.
Conspiracy theories are common in online discussions.
Conspiracy theories complicate efforts to understand them and to limit their spread.
It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to understand conspiracy theories in online communities.
What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online What are the recurring elements in their discussions What do these elements tell us about the way users think This study looks at 10 years of online discussions on a Reddit community that talks about conspiracy theories
We focus on the key elements of a theory about a secret plot the conspirators the actions they perform and their targets
a pattern of government control over information represents the various ways in which multiple statements denote how governmental agencies control information.
narrative-motifs show similarities between different conspiracy theories even when they're about different events
In the process, these representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about.
Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.
It's understandable to believe in conspiracy theories as they do happen because conspiracies occur and if we take an evidence-based approach belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases but fairly understandable
I examine the kinds of evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories, showing that the problems with conspiracy theories are not unique to such theories.
As such if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorist’s use of evidence it is one of principle is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error I argue that no matter what people think about conspiracy theories there is no good reason to doubt conspiracy theories based on how they use evidence
Cryptocurrency is a financial innovation that has attracted a lot of people around the world.
Cryptocurrency's rapid price changes and inconsistent government policies have caused public security concerns.
In this paper we analyze the risks of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history.
The cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable.
Blockchain technology is developed for Bitcoin the most common cryptocurrency.
Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular
Individuals and organizations can benefit from blockchain with its ability to make transactions between people more secure and easier between entities.
We look at what makes people want to use a blockchain cryptocurrency.
We develop a model to help understand why people accept cryptocurrency.
We offer evidence for a better understanding with practical implications in government.
Cryptocurrency was built initially as a digital currency. Various derivatives were created in fields such as financial transactions and capital management.
This paper aims to offer insights to help understand cryptocurrency.
We compare cryptocurrency with foreign exchange and stock.
Our investigation suggests that cryptocurrency are more similar to stock
The cryptocurrency market is a high-risk market.
The people are now owning more smartphones and other similar devices and mobile payment has become one of the payment methods in many different areas.
Blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a type of currency and its total value has reached USD 200 billion.
it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency on mobile devices
Considering the lack of good roads and limited access to banking in many countries, this combination is especially attractive.
The main problems with mobile payments using cryptocurrency are high costs and slow processing.
We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment. One involves a bank. The other does not require any centralized party.
We provide a solution for the bank to meet customer and anti-money laundering compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.
Research has focused on how financial crises spread and how investors follow each other's actions in the market.
Less has been said about financial news and the markets.
We propose a new way to measure news on the Web. It can be used to see if there is a risk in the market.
We evaluate financial data from various news sources over two years and analyse the relationship between financial markets and news about finance.
We think financial news affects the markets.
Cohesiveness is a general measure of risk in news than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms.
Our results show that financial news is highly correlated with the financial markets.
I explore how different financial markets move together.
The entropy is derived from stock markets in developed economies.
I study how a shock in the US economy affects other markets.
I also model the entropy using a dynamic factor model and derive a common factor behind the entropy movements in these four markets. I find a pattern in the markets and explain how they are connected
Mobile devices are very common in everyone’s life.
Nowadays such devices come with many features.
people can use these devices for diverse applications
These devices are popular and can be used for bad things.
Many smartphones are involved in cyber crimes.
So it becomes necessary to analyze such devices with special tools.
This paper discusses types of digital evidence found in Windows Mobile phones and a safe way to take data from the device.
It describes a tool for acquiring and analyzing mobile devices.
The growing number of IoT devices makes it likely that they will be important in digital forensic investigations in the future.
These devices often have limited standard interfaces for communication, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth.
With a growing focus on user data security and privacy, IoT devices increasingly come with built-in encryption.
A significant challenge is presented to investigators where data from devices needs to be analysed.
This work explores the electromagnetic analysis literature for the purpose of assisting investigations on IoT devices.
Side-channel analysis is a technique where devices leak information through their electromagnetic emissions.
EM side-channel approaches are a viable option for digital forensic investigations.
The literature on different types of attacks on devices that use electromagnetic signals are discussed – selected on the basis of their usefulness in investigating IoT devices.
The insight gained from the background study is used to identify future uses of the technique for investigating IoT devices – potentially helping with more investigations.
Mobile phone forensics is used to investigate fraud.
But mobile phones have become smartphones, and fraudsters have followed them.
Smartphones are packed with functionality that can easily be used for data theft or unwanted contact with other parties and is to all intents and purposes off the grid.
Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued. Processes must be in place when suspicions are raised.
Detecting corporate fraudsters is a constant game of catch-up.
It's not just about playing catch-up with the person who commits e-fraud.
The methods used to hide fraudulent activities are constantly evolving.
This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or just good old-fashioned theft.
Phishers are constantly changing the appearance of websites to trick people into thinking they are legitimate.
Manipulations can be as subtle as computer code changes or as apparent as adding or removing significant content.
To appropriately respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, a group of algorithms to detect phishing websites, using a large collection of past phishing attacks on many brands.
some approaches can achieve a detection rate of over 90% while keeping false positives low
The focus of the after exercise is to fix the body's internal balance recovering from the changes exercise made to the body's balance and help it adapt to exercise and reverse exercise stress to the body
Recommended nutritional strategies to maximize recovery include protein for muscle repair and carbs for energy replenishment.
Eating muscle contraction and eating high protein help activate a key protein pathway which stimulates to stimulate protein translation enhancing rates of muscle protein synthesis
Soon after exercise, eating around 20-25 grams of high-quality protein can help build muscle.
Some sports involve the intake of large amounts of alcohol after training and competition.
The outcomes of binge drinking after exercise are likely to include the direct effect of alcohol on the body as well as the effect on the athlete's recovery due to not eating or resting.
Although alcohol can be bad for muscle recovery after exercise, it may not affect how the body rebuilds protein.

We hypothesized that alcohol would decrease muscle protein synthesis compared to eating after exercise.
Eight healthy physically active male subjects age 21.4±4.8 yr, body mass 79.3±11.9 kg, peak oxygen uptake 48.1 mL/kg/min, maximum leg extension 104±20 kg who had been participating in regular exercise 3 times wk−1 for >6 months volunteered for this study.
The study employed a randomized design in which each subject completed bouts of consecutive resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity exercise with either post-exercise ingestion of alcohol-carbohydrate (ALC-CHO), alcohol-protein (ALC-PRO) or protein only (PRO) beverages on three separate occasions.
Eight sets of five repetitions at a high level of resistance.
Subjects rested for 5 minutes before commencing 30 minutes of continuous cycling at 63% of their maximum possible power output.
Subjects rested on the bike for 2 minutes before undertaking high intensity intervals at 110% of their personal peak output, with 30 seconds of active recovery between each work bout.
Following exercise and after 4 hours, subjects ingested a 500 mL solution of either protein or an energy-match in the form of carbohydrates.
A meal was consumed about 2 hours after exercise.
The 8 h time frame represents an important phase of recovery as well as the period during which blood alcohol concentrations are likely to be elevated after drinking and after exercise.
The alcohol ingestion protocol (1.5 grams per kilogram of body mass; 12-14 standard drinks) began 1 h post-exercise and was consumed in 6 equal volumes of 1 part vodka (~60 mL) to four parts orange juice (~240 mL) during a 3 h period.
For a special condition (PRO), orange juice was consumed with a matched volume of water instead of the alcohol.
Subjects ingested the beverages every 30 minutes.
Blood, cell signaling and mRNA data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Myofibrillar protein synthesis was analyzed by ANOVA.
The first novel finding of this study was that mTOR signaling and muscle protein synthesis were impaired during the early recovery phase by the ingestion of large amounts of alcohol after a tough team sports-like workout.
There was a significant decrease in muscle growth when athletes didn't take protein after exercise due to alcohol as is likely to occur when intoxication reduces the athlete's compliance to sound recovery practices leading to a 37% decrease in muscle growth
However, a second finding was that even when protein was consumed in amounts shown to be effective to stimulate muscle protein synthesis during recovery, the intake of alcohol reduced it by 24%, representing only a partial 'rescue' of the response compared with protein alone.
The mTORC1 is a central node that connects nutrient and exercise signals.
The current data provide the novel observation that alcohol impairs the response in exercise recovery.
The quantity of alcohol consumed in the current study was based on drinking by athletes.
Published reports suggest intakes of some individuals can be greater which is of concern for health and safety.
It's hard to find info on how drinking affects sports performance.

We propose our data is very interesting to athletes and coaches.
Our findings provide an evidence-base for a message of moderation in alcohol intake to promote recovery after exercise with the potential to alter current sports culture and athlete practices.
In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely there's limited proof that exercise causes muscle growth to increase strength.
Muscle size changes cause long-term strength changes are thought to be mainly due to muscle size changes.
There has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for muscle size and strength.
A change in muscle size affects a change in strength.
We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on a weak link between muscle growth and strength gain after training the loss of muscle mass with detraining yet a maintenance of muscle strength Similar muscle growth is seen in both low load and high load resistance training but the results differ in terms of strength
Light pressure occlusion training helps build muscle.
Training at intensities as low as 20% 1 repetition maximum with moderate vascular occlusion results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as 3 weeks.
to 3 to 5 sets with short rest periods
The metabolic buildup causes a rise in growth hormone.
Occlusion training is applicable for those who are unable to sustain high loads due to joint pain, recent surgery, heart conditions, athletes recovering, and astronauts.
Exercise has a small effect on muscle size.
Regular exercise makes muscles bigger.
These findings show a new way of thinking about muscle mass and how exercise can help prevent muscle loss. They provide a new perspective on skeletal muscle mass regulation and insight into exercise measures for people who are prone to muscle loss.
Stretch training is used to increase joint range of motion and prevent injuries.
Some research indicates that stretch training may cause muscle growth. However, most studies have been done on animals and in a lab.
Is stretch training a viable strategy to induce muscle hypertrophy?
10 studies 3 found that stretch training improved muscle structure and had some significantly positive effects
In these studies stretching was done with a machine or extra weight.
Of 5 studies that added stretching to their workouts, 2 applied the stretching in the interset rest period and were the ones that showed enhanced muscle growth.
Low-intensity stretching doesn't make muscles bigger or change their shape but some studies show that stretching with more force may help muscles grow
Regular cycling is part of many exercise programs seeking to improve heart health
The effect of cycle training on muscle size and strength gain is still not fully understood. Professional cyclists have larger muscle size compared to non-athletes.
Therefore the purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycle training on muscle size and strength of the lower extremity and how cycle training leads to bigger muscles.
It is plausible that cycle training requires a longer period to increase muscle size compared to typical resistance training.
Cycle training leads to muscle growth in both young and older adults while strength gain seems to favor older adults older adults have better muscle quality than young adults which suggests that the probability for improving in muscle quality appears to be higher in older adults compared to young adults
Young adults may need to do high-intensity cycling to get stronger.
Muscle hypertrophy induced by cycle training results from the positive changes in muscle protein balance.
Resistance training is the most effective method to increase muscle mass.
It has also been shown to promote many health benefits.
Although it is considered safe and useful for treating many diseases, a time-efficient and minimal dose of exercise has been the focus of many research studies.
a U-shaped relationship between training and how the body reacts has been hypothesized to exist
Most evidence shows a clear link between the dose and effect, such as muscle hypertrophy and health outcomes.
there is a lack of data to support the inverted U-shaped response
The main idea argued herein is that volume is the most easily modifiable variable that has an evidenced-based response be these muscle hypertrophy or health-related outcomes
The effects of short versus long rest intervals in resistance training on muscle hypertrophy have been investigated. The findings are equivocal.
Research shows that both short and long breaks between sets can be helpful for building muscle
Muscle hypertrophy suggests a possible advantage for the use of long rest intervals.
However due to not many studies with similar designs further research is needed to provide a clear differentiation between these two approaches.
Memory is a process that stores information and retrieves it.
For animals, it happens in the brain.
This review describes a type of muscle memory in skeletal muscle. It allows a muscle that has been large before but lost its mass to regain mass faster than a new muscle.
A new cell model based on the latest research with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei can explain this phenomenon.
new muscle fibers get nuclei from helper cells before they grow
Even if after atrophy, the muscle cells are protected from the effects of atrophy and the muscle cells' nuclei are protected from cell death.
Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise
This memory last for a long time.
Muscle function in the elderly is harder to improve and early strength training is recommended for public health.
eating small frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance
Several studies show that eating less is related to being thinner.
The purpose of this review is to present and discuss a summary of studies using statistical methods to analyze experimental research on meal frequency with respect to changes in fat mass and lean mass.
Feeding frequency helps reduce body fat and increase muscle mass.
single study found that more frequent meals may not affect body composition
The initial results suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition.
Inactive adults experience a 5% loss of muscle mass per decade leading to weight gain.
Ten weeks of resistance training can increase your weight by 1.4 kg and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg.
Benefits of resistance training include physical performance and independence
Resistance training may assist prevention and management of type 2 diabetes by reducing belly fat lowering blood sugar levels and helping the body handle sugar better increasing the density of glucose transporter type 4 and improving insulin sensitivity
Resistance training may enhance cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure and improving cholesterol levels.
Resistance training may promote bone development.
Resistance training may be effective for reducing back pain and discomfort from conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia and has been shown to reverse specific aging factors in skeletal muscle.
Physical activity is a good way to prevent diseases and improve health.
Late in life, strength training should be started.
However such advices seem to have a mainly anecdotal nature
Does not seem to have any aversion against strength training by children and adolescents, as long as some safety rules are followed.
Several studies support the benefits of intense physical efforts in young subjects.
Improved motor skills and body composition in terms of increased fat free mass, reduced fat mass and enhanced bone health have been documented in children and teenagers when the subjects were pubescent.
Strength training is a safe and healthy practice for kids.
Human aging results in changes to muscle.
Muscle loss happens as people get older and it causes musculoskeletal problems in the elderly.
Resistance training can help older adults.
The purpose of this review was to 1) present the current state of literature regarding the effects of resistance training on older adults and 2) provide guidelines for clinicians to use with seniors during exercise.
We show that resistance training can improve mobility, including gait speed and reducing the risk of falls.
Older adults should be encouraged to participate in regular exercise and should be moved towards more activity at appropriate daily exercise levels.
Maximizing the hypertrophic response to resistance training is thought to be best achieved by adjusting the exercise program to get the best results including choosing the right exercises rest times and training intensity
An often overlooked variable that may impact muscle growth is repetition duration.
Duration amounts to the sum total of the repetition components, and is predicated on the tempo at which the repetition is performed
We conducted a study and analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT.
Similar outcomes when training with different repetition times
if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth a fairly wide range can be employed
Findings suggest that training at very slow durations is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions
Recovery from exercise refers to the time period after exercise and when your body returns to normal

The cardiovascular system recovers after exercise over a short period, changing how it works over time.
Some of these changes may be necessary for long-term adaptation to exercise training, yet some can cause health problems during recovery.
Furthermore some of these changes may provide insight into when the system has recovered from previous training and is ready for more exercise.

Primary emphasis will be placed on the effect of exercise on blood pressure and the mechanisms that have clinical relevance, but can lead to low blood pressure and fainting spells.
We focus on the practical application of this information to help with heart health after exercise.
We will explore field measures and discuss how they can guide an athlete's training.
Exercise is becoming a key tool in treating and preventing some medical conditions.
Exercise has favorable effects on reducing cardiovascular risk, inflammation, and hypertension. It also increases physical functioning and strength.
Chronic kidney disease is a common condition that affects many people and is often overlooked as a target for exercise-based therapy.
Despite various stages of kidney disease e.g. pre-dialysis dialysis transplant exercise has a potential role in all patients suffering from the condition
Exercise plays an important role in treating kidney disease treatment and this form of treatment should be carefully planned.
Blood flow restriction (BFR) is an effective way to build strength.
Its effects on pain are unknown
To see if adding a special technique to weight training helps people with knee pain.
Systematic review of randomized clinical trials
Studies comparing resistance exercise with or without BFR to treat knee pain and function in individuals with knee pain were included.
The a statistical estimate of the average difference between groups showed that resistance exercises with BFR was not more effective than resistance exercises for reducing pain SMD: -0.37cm 95% CI=-0.93 0.19 and improving knee function SMD=-0.23 points 95% CI=-0.71 0.26 in patients with knee pain.
In Japan, there were about 43 million people with high blood pressure in 2010.
The managing of the condition is given the highest priority in treating high blood pressure and the importance of lifestyle changes has been recognized in Japan.
Emphasis has been placed on engaging in daily activities and physical exercise (sports).
In this literature review we examined exercise prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension as described in articles.
This review recommends safe and effective whole-body aerobic exercise at moderate intensity that primarily focuses on the major muscle groups for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Exercise should be 30 minutes to 1 hour per session, 3-4 times a week.
Resistance exercise should be performed at low intensity. It is not suitable for people with hypertension who have chest pain.
there has been a public interest in IFast
athletic performance is affected by nutrition
Research on high-intensity endurance and resistance exercises found no benefit to athletic performance when fasting.
Every person who exercises encounters times when they have little time for exercise due to conflicts.
During such periods the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain instead of improving physical performance.
athletes and military personnel may desire to maintain performance
Endurance performance can be maintained for a certain amount of time when training is reduced.
Strength and muscle size can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with one session of strength training per week and one set per exercise, as long as the intensity is maintained in younger populations. In older populations, maintaining muscle size may require more frequent exercise.
exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time, despite big cuts in exercise frequency and amount
Nutrient timing involves eating the right foods around exercise.
Many people believe this approach improves body composition.
It has been suggested that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the daily intake of nutrients.
The post-exercise period is the most critical part of nutrient timing.
Consuming the proper ratio of nutrients helps repair muscle damage and rebuild energy stores in a way that enhances body composition and exercise performance.
Several researchers have made reference to a time after training to optimize muscle adaptations.
the importance of a post-exercise window can vary
Nutrient timing is open to question in terms of applicability. Recent evidence challenges the idea that eating after exercise is important for muscle growth.
Lack of time is among the common barriers to exercise.
The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out by reviewing research on training methods new techniques and proper warm-up and stretching.
When programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing exercises that work multiple joints and muscles and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise and one upper-body pulling exercise and one upper-body pushing exercise
Exercises can be done with machines or free weights based on what you want to achieve and what you have.
Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency. We recommend performing a minimum of 4 sets per muscle group, using a moderate load that allows 6-15 reps, and continue to the point of exhaustion.
Advanced training techniques, such as special training methods roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume.
However, these methods are probably better for muscle growth than for building strength and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects
We advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.
Training frequency is important in exercise.
The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies designed to investigate the effects of weekly training frequency on hypertrophic adaptations.
Results showed no difference between higher and lower frequency.
Significant effect favoring higher frequencies was found. The difference in effect between different frequencies was not very large.
There is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not impact muscle hypertrophy when volume is the same.
Thus for a given training volume individuals can choose a weekly frequency per muscle groups based on personal preference
Specialized training techniques help build muscle.
Forced repetitions and drop sets can help build muscle especially when done with heavy weights
This article will explore the role of these techniques in building muscle and provide an insight into possible applications to training programs.
Many people who lift weights try to build muscle.
Research is lacking however as to the best approach for muscle growth.
Bodybuilders train with short rest intervals that induce high stress.
They train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods between sets.
It is not clear which method is superior for muscle growth.
Many factors contribute to muscle growth and that mechanical tension muscle damage and metabolic stress all can play a role in muscle growth
We will review the research on how muscles grow and apply it to exercise. to find the best way to make muscles grow.

Participants transcribed text presented on a computer screen into a digital assistant using a stylus and one of two keyboards.
We introduced a new technique for measuring transcription rate.
We introduced a new technique for measuring typing speed that provides a composite measure of speed and accuracy.
Using this technique we calculated the maximum transcription rate for each keyboard
The results show that the QWERTY keyboard has a faster typing rate than the T9 keyboard despite the T9's better design.
Transcription rates were higher for the QWERTY keyboard than for the T9 keyboard.
A small experiment showed that the T9 layout didn't work well because it's hard to scan quickly.
A separate experiment demonstrated that the poorer performance of the T9 layout may have resulted from an increase in visual scanning time due to how our eyes group letters on the keys.
Together these findings imply that the QWERTY keyboard layout remains the most effective of the available designs for touch typing.
Together these findings imply that the QWERTY keyboard layout remains the most effective of the currently available designs for stylus tapping on soft keyboards

mobile devices are used to access the web
We implemented a viewer system that transforms Web content into content useful for mobile devices.
Extracting images and text from Web content generates a Flash file, a popular format.
Mobile devices show web pages in a similar way to personal computers web content looks different on different devices
However, comparing mobile and desktop terminals, some difference in device features, such as screen quality or sound, affect how it looks on the terminal.
when changing the access style the presentation should be adjusted for the terminal type because information is not perceived after transformation
To adjust the play style to the terminal type we developed a method for presentation.
First we represent the emotional aspect of a Web page by adjusting the background color of the screen
We highlight the main point.
Break it into parts and show them one by one using visual effects.
These procedures can be applied to any terminal

we report on the outline of educational materials that we developed and the evaluation of the practices using it
Mobile devices have small screens and low resolution making it hard to use web apps on the go
Web pages are often too large for a PDA screen to present.
The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV
It would be easier to rebuild web pages for these devices, but the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have to customize a web page for each possible display device.
We propose a document segmentation and presentation system.
The system divides a web document into a number of segments based on the screen size and the document's structure.
Information like summaries is extracted to help navigation.
The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for finding information.
