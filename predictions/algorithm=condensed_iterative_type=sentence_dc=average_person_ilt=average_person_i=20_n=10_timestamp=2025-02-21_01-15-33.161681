In the modern era of automation, autonomous vehicles are the focus of research.
With more drones being used in civilian and commercial activities, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to government rules for drones, drone navigation is getting attention
We propose a solution that lets a drone learn to fly like an expert by observing how they do it and it should be able to drive through city streets.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms our classifier has been constructed in the form of a special computer model that looks for roads in images
Our system performs better than many existing models
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone by flying it in urban areas by experts with a lot of flying experience.
Permission was taken from the right authorities who made sure that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process.
We have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting.
A system enables the drone to fly fast The drone flies fast
