In the modern era of automation and robotics, self-driving cars are the focus of research.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to rules set by the government, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
We propose a solution to drone navigation by following an expert, with learning from a skilled pilot, using data
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier was built using a computer program, that evaluates the presence of roads using the reconstructed images of the input frames and a 39-layered computer model.
