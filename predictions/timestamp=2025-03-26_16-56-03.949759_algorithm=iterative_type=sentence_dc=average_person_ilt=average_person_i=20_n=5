In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of industry and academia.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in activities in both civilian and commercial settings, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a data-driven approach to teaching drones to navigate cities by learning from an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep neural network model, that evaluates the presence of roads using images of the input frames.
