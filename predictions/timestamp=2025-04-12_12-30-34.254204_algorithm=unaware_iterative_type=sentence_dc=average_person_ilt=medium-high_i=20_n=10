The modern era of automation autonomous cars are currently the focus of industrial and academic research.
With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Road-tracking navigation is garnering interest due to rules.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning based solution to drone navigation for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been made using a powerful computer system, that evaluates the presence of roads using tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system performs better in terms of accuracy than many existing models for imitation based on a computer program.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process.
We have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing, with high accuracy.
It goes quickly
