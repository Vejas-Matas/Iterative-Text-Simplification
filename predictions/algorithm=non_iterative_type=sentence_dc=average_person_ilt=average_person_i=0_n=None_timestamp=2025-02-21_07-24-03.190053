Online social media allow users to see many different opinions.
Individuals can choose to expose themselves to information that supports their own views and avoid opposing views through various means.
A precise understanding of trade-offs is still missing.
Some people in a network update their ideas based on new information but a few people only accept news that agree with what they already believe.
This simple mechanism can cause people's opinions to become more extreme and divided.
Agents behave as if they're biased because their neighbours restrict their access to information.
We show how people's beliefs are affected by what they hear from others and the Internet.
Small doses of confirmation bias can actually improve accuracy in groups by keeping a mix of ideas.
When confirmation bias gets too strong accuracy goes down as people stop sharing information with each other.
Our model's results have policy implications we discuss here.
The internet changed the way we get information.
People tend to choose information that fits their views and group with others who share similar ideas ignoring opposing views.
Users work together to agree on a story and support each other's views making it hard to disagree.
Many people get their news from social media and it seems that when we disagree on things we see more false information.
We looked at how users in different European countries such as Italy France Spain and Germany react to news on Facebook.
We compare how people interact with pages across different countries.

We analyze the cryptojacking landscape further by looking at code characteristics and the potential mining revenue and current ways to prevent it.
Modern blockchains enable the creation of smart contracts which are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain.
Smart contracts are becoming more popular with uses in law business commerce and governance. They are written in a high-level language like Solidity and then turned into a smaller low-level code for use on the blockchain.
The bytecode is run by a computer program.
Smart contracts can be vulnerable to attacks due to poor programming.
Smart contracts are high-value targets often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency.
Developers and auditors need security frameworks that can check for potential security problems in code.

It classifies images in pairs as similar or different using a special kind of neural network.
Once the network learns to tell apart different image editing operations it can also identify operations not shown during training.
The proposed method is effective in detecting different image editing operations.

An autonomous robot often looks for a user to do a task.
When the person moves around the robot can't see everything because its view is limited and the environment gets in the way.
We propose a new method that predicts how visible a user is in different locations in a given environment using computer simulations.
The robot takes into account how long it takes to reach possible locations and visibility constraints when determining where to search.
The robot chooses the next location to search where it is most likely to see the user.
Our experiments show that our approach is faster than a common way of searching with background information.
Users often follow typical routes to specific places where a mobile robot can be useful.
Following a robot's optimal path may be better than following a human's step-by-step path.
We're proposing a way for a robot to predict human movements and use that information to make better decisions.
The robot's view of the human is often blocked by obstacles. This makes it hard to predict where the human is going.

These guidelines would address how to hide data in a way that's legal and technical, what's considered unfair or even illegal, different types of privacy problems and non-privacy problems and how to help people by giving them access to their data in a way they can understand.
Smart speakers with voice interaction are becoming more common and people are getting used to speaking to them.
Speech recognition and natural language processing have improved a lot but users still sometimes encounter errors like being unable to understand what was said or having issues with certain audio resources.
When an error is reported the smart speaker needs to give a good response.
Chinese smart speaker brands mainly differ in two ways apology or humor.
We looked at how users react to two types of errors.

People tried to make sense of a health crisis by talking about conspiracy theories because they didn't trust official information.
Implications for social computing researchers health practitioners and policymakers are discussed.
Conspiracy theories are common in online discussions.
Conspiracy theories spread and become harder to understand and stop.
Developing methods to study online communities is important.
Users discuss conspiracy theories online about various topics they think are hidden or untrue.
Conspiracy theorists often focus on three main elements: the people behind the conspiracy, their actions, and who they are targeting.
Government agencies control information in various ways.
Narrative-motifs reveal connections between different conspiracy theories.
These representations help us understand how people talk about conspiracy theories.
Our approach allows us to study a large number of people believing in conspiracy theories on the internet and understand how to stop them spreading.
Belief in conspiracy theories is sometimes understandable and can be justified in some cases when looked at individually.
Evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories is not unique to such theories.
There's no good reason to distrust conspiracy theories just because of how they use evidence.

Mobile phone forensics is used to investigate fraud.
Mobile phones have become smartphones and scammers have adapted.
Smartphones can be used for secret data theft or contact with others without the company knowing.
Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued.
Detecting corporate fraudsters is a constant challenge.
It's not just about understanding the e-fraudster's motives but also the technology they misuse.
Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to hide their activities from corporate networks where they can be detected.
A company's confidential information is at risk of being stolen.
Phishers change the code of websites to look like real websites and avoid detection.
These can be big or small changes.
A set of computer programs is used to identify websites that are likely to be phishing sites based on their content.
Some content-based approaches can detect with a high success rate and very few mistakes.
The first few hours after exercise are important for reversing the changes that exercise caused to the body's balance and functions and for helping the body adapt to the exercise.
To recover well in skeletal muscle, eat protein to build it back up and carbohydrates to refill its energy stores.
Muscle contraction and eating protein that is high in leucine send different but related signals to the body that meet at the mTOR to help build muscle.
Consuming 20-25 grams of high quality protein after exercise and then every 4 hours can help build muscle.
Athletes in some team sports often drink a lot of alcohol after training and competition.
Binge drinking after exercise can cause problems due to the direct effect of alcohol on the body and the athlete's slow recovery from not eating or resting properly.
Consuming carbohydrates after drinking can help reduce some negative effects on the body's ability to rebuild its energy stores after exercise. However the effect of drinking on muscle repair is not well understood.
This study looked at how alcohol affects muscle recovery after hard exercise in athletes.
Consuming alcohol with a meal after exercise can slow down muscle growth.
Eight healthy men aged 21 on average participated in the study. They were physically active and weighed around 79 kilograms on average. They could lift around 104 kilograms in one repetition.
People did exercises of different types with different drinks after each exercise. They had three types of drinks: one with alcohol and carbs, one with alcohol and protein, and one with only protein.
Eight sets of five repetitions at 80% of maximum strength.
After a rest, subjects cycled for 30 minutes.
After resting for 2 minutes on the bike, the subjects did 10 30-second sprints at their highest intensity, followed by 30 seconds of rest at a lower intensity.
After exercise, subjects drank a 500 mL solution of either protein or an energy-match in the form of carbohydrates.
A special meal was eaten about 2 hours after exercise to help with muscle recovery.
The 8 hour time frame is a critical period for recovery after exercise and also when blood alcohol levels are likely to be high after drinking.
People drank 1.5 grams of alcohol for every kilogram of body weight 1 hour after exercise. They consumed this in 6 equal drinks over 3 hours. Each drink was 1 part vodka and 4 parts orange juice.
Orange juice was consumed with water instead of alcohol.
People drank the beverages every 30 minutes.
Blood and cell signaling data were analyzed with special tests to compare two groups over time. Protein synthesis in muscle cells was also measured and compared.
Exercise after drinking a lot of alcohol can temporarily reduce muscle growth after a tough workout.
When people drank alcohol after exercise and didn't eat protein afterwards they felt much better.
Even when eating the right amount of protein to boost muscle recovery after exercise, drinking alcohol still reduced muscle growth by about 24%.
The mTORC1 is a key part of the body's system that helps balance food and exercise signals.
Alcohol impairs muscle recovery after exercise.
The amount of alcohol consumed in this study was based on how much athletes reported drinking during binge drinking episodes.
Some people consume much more than the recommended amount which is a concern for their health and safety.
Many athletes struggle to find evidence linking alcohol consumption with sports performance.
When you drink alcohol after exercise your muscles don't recover as well even if you're eating a healthy diet.
We propose our data is of interest to athletes.
Our research suggests that drinking alcohol in moderation can help people recover after exercise.
We revisit a classic idea about exercise and muscle growth that was first discussed a long time ago.
Muscle size is thought to be the main factor in long-term strength adaptations.
There has been a lot of research on programs that help people build both strong and big muscles.
The idea that bigger muscles lead to more strength is not well supported by research.
These changes may be separate phenomena due to the weak link between muscle size and strength after training and the fact that muscle mass decreases with detraining but strength remains the same as well as the similar muscle growth from low-load and high-load resistance training but different results in strength.
Low-intensity occlusion training promotes muscle hypertrophy.
Low intensity training can cause muscle growth in just 3 weeks.
Do 3 to 5 sets of exercise until you can't do more.
The metabolic buildup causes a rise in growth hormone at higher levels than with higher intensities.
Those who have joint pain or are recovering from surgery can benefit from occlusion training.
Aerobic exercise is often thought to have little effect on muscle size.
Exercise can make muscles bigger and change how the body uses protein.
These findings challenge the current understanding of how muscles grow and lose mass and offer new ideas for helping people who lose muscle.
Stretch training is used to improve joint flexibility and prevent injuries.
Some research suggests that stretching may help build muscle but most of these studies are done on animals or in a lab.
This review looks at whether stretching can help build muscle in humans.
Three studies found that stretching helps muscle structure.
The stretching was done with special help or with extra weight.
Two studies that combined stretching with resistance training showed improved muscle growth.
Low-intensity stretching does not help build muscle size and shape. However some evidence suggests that stretching with a bit of tension may cause muscle growth.
Regular exercise is a key part of improving cardiovascular health.
Professional cyclists have bigger muscles than non-cyclists.
This review discusses the effects of cycle training on the size and strength of the muscles in the lower body and how it can increase muscle size.
Cycle training takes longer to increase muscle size compared to regular weight training.
Muscle training helps both young and older people build muscle. However older people tend to get stronger faster than young people.
Young adults need high-intensity cycling to build strength.
Muscle hypertrophy from cycling is due to increased protein balance in the muscle.
Resistance training is the best way to build muscle.
It has many health benefits.
Exercise has been a major focus of research for treating and preventing diseases.
An inverted U-shaped relationship between training dose and physiological response has been hypothesized to exist.
The majority of available evidence supports a clear link between how much weight you lift and muscle growth.
There is a lack of data to support the inverted U-shaped response.
Volume is the most easily changed factor that has a strong effect with significant consequences.
The effects of rest intervals in resistance training on muscle growth have been studied but the results are unclear.
Both short and long rest intervals can help when training for muscle growth.
Trained participants who rested for a long time after exercising may experience muscle growth.
Further research is needed to understand the differences between these two approaches.
Information is stored in the brain.
For vertebrates the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain.
Muscle fibres that have been large before can regain mass faster than new ones.
A new cell biological model can explain this phenomenon.
Muscle fibres can grow by recruiting new nuclei from satellite cells.
Even if muscle tissue is severely damaged, it still has a higher number of muscle nuclei and these nuclei are protected from the increased cell death that occurs in damaged muscle tissue.
Fibres that have had more strength exercises grow faster when they are overworked and the number of their nuclei shows how strong they have been.
Human memory might be very long lasting because myonuclei in our brains are stable for at least 15 years.
Older people find it harder to build muscle memory and it might be better to start exercising early in life.
Eating small meals often may help with weight loss.
Several studies show that eating less is linked to lower body fat.
This review looks at studies to see how often people eat meals and how it affects their body weight.
Eating more often was linked to losing body fat and gaining muscle mass.
A single study found that eating more often may be beneficial for body composition but this result may not be reliable.
These initial results suggest a potential benefit of eating more often for body composition.
As we age muscles slowly start to shrink losing 3 to 8 percent of their mass each decade.
Resistance training can lead to weight gain of 1.4 kg in lean weight and a 7% increase in resting metabolic rate.
Resistance training improves physical performance and movement control also helps with walking speed and independence.
Resistance training can help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes by reducing belly fat and making the body more sensitive to insulin.
Resistance training can help lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels.
Resistance training can help build bone density.
Resistance training can help reduce back pain and ease discomfort from arthritis and fibromyalgia. It also helps reverse muscle aging.
Regular exercise can help prevent many diseases and improve overall health.
Experts recommend delaying intense strength training until late in growth.
These suggestions seem unreliable.
Children can do strength training as long as they get medical clearance and proper instruction from a professional.
Several studies show that intense physical exercise is good for young people.
Improved motor skills and body composition were better if people started sports early when they were young.
Strength training is safe and healthy for kids.
As people age, their muscles undergo changes.
Muscle mass decreases with age and this loss contributes to muscle weakness in older people.
Resistance training can help older adults move around better.
This review looked at how resistance training affects older adults with muscle weakness and provides guidance for seniors and their clinicians.
Resistance training can help older adults walk faster and be less likely to fall.
Older adults should be encouraged to exercise and move more.
Maximizing muscle growth from weightlifting is achieved by adjusting the workout program such as the exercises used the order they are done rest breaks and the intensity of the weights.
Another factor that affects muscle growth is the length of time spent on repetitions.
The total time of a repetition is the sum of the time spent on concentric, eccentric, and isometric movements.
We studied if changing how often people repeat exercise can make it more effective for building muscle.
Hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 seconds.
A fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed to maximize muscle growth.
Training at very slow speeds is not ideal for muscle growth.
The time after exercise when your body recovers.
After exercise there are specific physiological changes that are different from when we are resting or exercising.
The cardiovascular system recovers after exercise over a few minutes to a few hours.
Some changes may be necessary for long-term adaptation but can also cause instability during recovery.
Some of these changes may indicate when the cardiovascular system has recovered from training and is ready for more.
This review looks at how the body's blood flow changes after exercise and the reasons behind it after doing resistance and aerobic exercises.
The main focus will be on how exercise affects blood pressure and the reasons behind it but if left untreated it can lead to low blood pressure and fainting.
We focus on applying the information to make the most of cardiovascular recovery.
We will look at ways to measure athletic performance and how these measures can help guide an athlete's training.
Exercise is now used to help treat and prevent certain medical conditions like arthritis and diabetes.
Exercise has many health benefits including lowering blood pressure and improving physical strength.
Around 10% of people have chronic kidney disease and it is often overlooked as a target for exercise-based therapy.
Exercise can help people with kidney disease.
Exercise plays a significant role in managing kidney disease.
Blood flow restriction is a way to increase strength in healthy people.
Its effects on knee pain are unknown.
To see if adding a certain treatment to exercise helps people with knee pain feel better and move more easily.
Systematic review of clinical trials with a statistical analysis of the results.
Studies looked at whether doing resistance exercises with or without a specific blood flow restriction can help people over 18 with knee pain.
Resistance exercises with blood flow restriction was not more effective than regular resistance exercises for reducing pain and improving knee function in patients with knee pain.
In Japan there were 43 million people with high blood pressure in 2010.
Managing high blood pressure is a top priority in healthcare in Japan and making lifestyle changes can help prevent and treat it.
Increasing physical activity and exercise is being emphasized.
We examined exercise prescriptions for preventing and treating high blood pressure in various studies.
Do regular moderate-intensity exercise 3-4 times a week for 30-60 minutes to help prevent and treat high blood pressure.
Resistance exercise should be done at low intensity. It's not suitable for people with high blood pressure who experience chest pain.
There has been a renewed public interest in IFast.
Nutrition plays a big role in how well athletes perform.
Studies have shown that fasting does not improve athletic performance.
Most people who exercise have days when they don't have time.
During periods like these the goal of physical training is to maintain performance rather than improve it.
Athletes and military personnel may want to maintain their performance for a long time.
Endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training is reduced. This can happen when training is done 2 times a week or when the amount of exercise is reduced by a third to a half.
In younger people strength and muscle size can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with just one session of strength training per week and one set per exercise as long as the intensity is high enough. Older people however may need up to two sessions per week and two to three sets per exercise to maintain muscle size.
Exercise intensity is key to maintaining physical performance over time.
Consuming food with protein and carbohydrates before or after exercise is a popular idea in nutrition.
Some people claim this approach improves body composition.
The timing of eating food may be more important than how much of certain nutrients you get.
The post-exercise period is the most critical time for nutrient intake.
Consuming the right amount of nutrients during this time helps rebuild damaged muscle and restore energy. It also makes you stronger and performs better during exercise.
There's a limited time after training when the body can best adapt to it.
The importance of a post-exercise window can vary.
Nutrient timing research is open to question and may not be relevant to building muscle after exercise.
Time constraints are a common reason for not participating in exercise programs.
This review looked at how to do strength training in the least amount of time by examining research on certain training methods and techniques.
When doing strength training for the best results we recommend doing exercises that work multiple joints at once and include both pushing and pulling movements.
Exercises can be done with machines and/or free weights based on goals and preferences.
Perform at least 4 sets per muscle group each week using weights that allow 6 to 15 repetitions.
Using advanced training techniques like supersets and rest-pause training can save you about half the time of traditional training while still letting you do the same workout volume.
These methods are better at building muscle size than strength and more research is needed.
Restrict warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups and only prioritize stretching if the goal is to increase flexibility.
Training frequency is an important factor in muscle growth from weightlifting.
This paper looked at how often people should train to build muscle.
There was no difference in performance when the volume was equalized.
Studies that compared different exercise frequencies found that higher frequencies were more effective but the difference was not extremely large.
Resistance training frequency does not significantly impact muscle growth when the total amount of exercise is the same.
Individuals can choose a weekly training frequency based on personal preference.
Specialized training techniques are used to increase muscle growth.
Heavy weightlifting techniques like drop sets and supersets can help build muscle.
This article will explore the role of these techniques in building muscle and look at how they can be used in weight training.
People who lift weights often try to build muscle.
More research is needed to determine the best approach for increasing muscle growth through exercise.
Bodybuilders train with moderate weights and short rest breaks.
Powerlifters train with heavy weights and long rests between sets.
It's not clear which method is better for building muscle.
Many factors contribute to muscle growth after exercise.
This paper has two main goals: to review how muscles grow and how exercise affects this process and to determine the best way to make muscles grow.

The web interface of mobile devices is very similar to that of personal computers.
Some differences in device characteristics like screen resolution or sound affect how things are displayed on a mobile or desktop terminal.
When you switch between interactive and passive access the presentation should be adjusted for the type of terminal.
We developed a method to adjust the way web content is presented to match different types of devices.
We adjust the background color of the screen to represent the emotional aspect of a Web page.
We emphasize the subject of the content by the logotype of the keyword.
Break the image into smaller parts and show them one by one with special effects.
These procedures can be applied to any terminal.
We developed a system called "The Beijing Explorer" that shares location information and user situations in real time using a device with a built-in GPS and wireless connection.
Users can see their location and messages on the PDA screen in real time.
The Palace Museum in Beijing China.
We did two experiments.
The experiments showed that the service with location and sharing features was valuable and interesting.
Positioning information is important for the guidance system.
A personal machine is different from traditional machines.
It's private and personal in a new way and it will often fail.
Distributed systems will treat Personal Digital Assistants as equals. They will store digital assets like money and keys.
The user should own and control their digital assets and the media that store and communicate them.
Our system is designed to show information to the user rather than hide it.
When systems are designed this way the user can make better decisions than the system itself based on the information provided.
This system is presented and discussed.
Depression is often overlooked in children.
This paper describes a system to help nurses identify depression in children aged 8 to 18.
Selection of a depression screening instrument integration of the instrument into a personal digital assistant and evaluation of the instrument
Only a third of eligible patients were screened.
About 20% of those tested were at risk for a mood disorder.
People said it's hard to screen because they don't have time, don't know what to do, don't have the right resources, or feel uncomfortable doing it.
Suggestions for education and research on PDA-based screening are discussed.
This study looked at how wireless technology can improve patient care and medical education.
This study used a review of existing research from several databases to gather information.
Most healthcare professionals and students now use digital assistants and this is expected to increase.
Wireless and mobile devices allow personal assistants to connect to the internet directly.
Studies on patient care should evaluate mobile computing technologies as a timesaving tool.
Wireless and mobile computing technologies are improving patient care and education.
They have shown a positive impact on patient safety and patient satisfaction.
Nursing students can learn many things by experiencing actual medical practice and meeting patients.
Practical training is an effective way for nursing students to develop their nursing skills.
Hospitals are not suitable for training with electrical devices due to safety concerns.
We created a system to help nurses practice their skills and review them anywhere, anytime using a portable device.
We developed an educational tool called the digital nursing dictionary and tested its use.
Limited by screen size and resolution on mobile devices.
Web pages are often too large for a PDA screen to present.
Devices with low resolution such as WebTV have the same problem.
Reconstructing web pages for these devices would be easier but web page designers would have to work much harder because of the many different displays.
We propose a system for breaking down and presenting documents.
The system breaks down a web page into sections based on its size and content.
Information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation.
The system presents a web document to make the most of the screen for searching information.
8-bit microcontroller C8051F005 is used as the core and a device for monitoring voltage harmonics is designed.
Fast Fourier Transform is used in the harmonic analysis algorithm.
This device has two modes.
It can communicate with the monitoring center through phone line and other devices.
Users can now access online information from anywhere with their devices.
People switch from large screens like desktops or laptops to small devices like a PDA.
Three common ways to show web pages on small screens are Direct Migration Linear and Overview.
We have a new way to view a web page on a small screen that uses what you already know about the page.
Users prefer using the Gateway and Direct Migration approach for large screen web pages.
Mobile systems have limitations that need to be considered in software development.
We've created a list of potential risks based on a questionnaire and used it for a device that helps with negotiations.
We will explore how to combine risk management strategies with Agile Methods.
Mobile services and private data need more protection.
Speaker recognition is a biometric technology that is simple, cheap, and convenient.
A speaker recognition system for authenticating voices is presented.
A large dataset from various devices is collected to test the system.
This paper presents a method to generate random pseudonyms in a network.
each user can generate his pseudonym locally in his personal security environment
his smart card or personal digital assistant
There is no need for information exchange between users and devices except for unique identifiers.
The holder can prove he generated a pseudonym without revealing his identity and can reveal his identity by disclosing the pseudonym.
The verifier of a pseudonym can be sure that the person presenting the pseudonym is its holder
the person which originally generated it
User and device identifiers will be encrypted and used to create unique pseudonyms.
Location-based services are important in today's society.
Users can access these services with their mobile devices to view city maps or get directions.
Mobile devices do not have the same computing power as a computer or laptop.
These deficits can be bypassed by using special methods in app development.
We developed a route planner for public transport.
Dividing the route calculation process into smaller steps helps reduce the workload on mobile devices.
