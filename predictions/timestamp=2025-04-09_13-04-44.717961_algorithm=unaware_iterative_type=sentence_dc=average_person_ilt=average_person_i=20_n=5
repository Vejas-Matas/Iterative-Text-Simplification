In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of research
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is a need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a learning from expert pilots to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been made in a special kind of AI model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
