autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research
There is an increased need for autonomy in unmanned aerial vehicles.
Due to rules set by the government for drone usage, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a learning from data approach to UAV autonomy for driving through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from traditional image classification methods, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep neural network that evaluates the presence of roads using computer-generated images.
Based on the Modified Inception, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts with significant flying experience.
Permissions were taken from authorities who made sure that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process.
With a large amount of data from drones, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%
MAVNet allows the drone to fly quickly up to 6 meters per second.
