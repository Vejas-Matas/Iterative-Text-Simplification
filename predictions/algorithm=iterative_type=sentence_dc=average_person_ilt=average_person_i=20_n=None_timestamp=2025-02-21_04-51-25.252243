In the modern age of automation autonomous vehicles are currently a focus of research.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones Navigation is popular
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using specialized images of the input frames.
Based on a specific computer model, our system performs better in terms of performance and quality than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in urban areas, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from the authorities to minimize the risk to pedestrians during data collection.
We collected a lot of data from our drones, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
The efficiency of the drone's system enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6 meters per second.
We present the same results in this research and compare them with other methods of navigation.
Recognizing Traffic Signs can drastically reduce the number of accidents happening worldwide.
With the arrival of Self-driving cars it has become a staple challenge to solve the recognition of traffic signs in the major streets.
Various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and deep learning models has been proposed for classifying traffic signs.
Though they reach best performance on a particular data-set, but fall short of tackling multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks.
In this paper, we propose a novel and all-in-one architecture that aces multiple benchmarks with better overall score than the state-of-the-art architectures.

With this we score 99.33% Accuracy in German and Belgian traffic sign recognition benchmarks.
Moreover we propose a new technique which uses low resources
We introduce Ignition: a neural network system for training self-driving vehicles in simulated environments.
The model is a ResNet-18 variant, which is fed in images from the front of a simulated F1 car, and outputs best driving instructions for steering, throttle, braking.
we never explicitly train the model to detect road features like the outline of a track or distance to other cars; instead we show that these features are naturally learned by the network
In this paper we present a transfer learning method for full control of cars which enables a neural network trained locally
A standard computer vision system for direct control is designed to map a single front-facing camera image to a steering command.
To enable learning from past experiences, we let a type of neural network produce not only the steering direction but also a lane departure level (LDL) by adding a new module that uses the final layer's output.
The CNN trained on the source domain, is then utilized to train another task module called target network, which also uses the output of the source network's final layer and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain.
The steering commands from the source and target systems are finally merged according to the LDL and the merged command is utilized for controlling a car in the new environment.

The results show that a new approach outperforms other baseline methods in terms of stable and safe control of cars.
A significant problem of using machine learning techniques is the limited amount of data available for training.
There are some datasets available for self-driving cars, however, it is very limited for industrial robotics.
we used a special type of artificial intelligence called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots (UR)
In this work, we extend our method to work with a new robot arm - Kuka LBR iiwa, which has a different appearance and an extra joint.
However, instead of collecting large datasets once again, we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred images each and use adapting the existing model to a new robot having different shapes and visual features.
Transfer learning is applicable in this field and requires smaller training datasets, trains faster and achieving similar accuracy to the original method. Transfer learning is applicable in this field and requires smaller training datasets, trains faster and achieving similar accuracy to the original method, even improving it on some aspects.
Automated decisions raise moral concerns in areas like self-driving cars and kidney exchanges.
In this paper we present specialized mathematical methods for planning and managing self-driving taxis wherein self-driving vehicles transport people within cities and rebalance themselves to ensure good service across the city
We first cast an autonomous system within a closed network model with passenger loss.
The theoretical insights are used to design a robust real-time rebalancing algorithm which is applied to a case study of New York City and tested on a fleet of eight vehicles.
New York's taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with 8,000 robotic vehicles, which is about 70% of the current taxi fleet.
Finally, we extend our basic traffic system to account for traffic jams, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall traffic congestion.
This paper presents a systematic way to coordinate self-driving cars, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.
After the digital revolution, we will see changes in our economy and society.
While the benefits of this transformation can be big, there are also risks to our society.
After the automation of production processes and the creation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next.
This is moving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads we must decide between a society where decisions are made from the top and enforced or a society in which decisions are made in a free and fair way
Modern technology and communication systems work together, but has economic and strategic benefits.
The foundations of human dignity, democracy, and making our own decisions, but I believe that they need to be vigorously defended, as they are not only key principles of a good society, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.
Once self-driving cars become a reality passengers will need to find new ways of entertainment.
However, getting entertainment from a central location can hinder content delivery service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication.

a special kind of computer model (MLP) predicts what content people might request in certain areas
To reduce the car-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into special computers at roadside units.
Second, in order to cache entertainment contents for car passengers' features such as age and gender a neural network is used to predict the age and gender of passengers
Through this the car can it needs from the server and save it.
we formulate caching in the self-driving car to enhance entertainment services

Our results show that our predictions are accurate for the contents need to be cached in the areas of the self-driving car is very accurate and helps reduce delays.
This paper describes the design, implementation, and successful use of the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a simple simulation of a centralised financial market, based on a Limit Order Book (LOB) such as is common in major stock exchanges.
Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the world’s major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by high-speed computer systems.
Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by the fact that no real-world market can be tested while it's open and running, forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data.

This BSE has been successfully used for teaching and research in a leading UK university since 2012, and the BSE program code is freely available as open-source on GitHuB
This paper provides a comprehensive study of how stock prices vary in response to financial disclosures across different topics.
We shed light into the large amount of filings for which no categorization exists.
For this purpose, we utilize an approach from data mining - namely, using a statistical method - about identifying topics.
This technique facilitates our task of automatically categorizing from the beginning the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. companies.
We then evaluate the stock market reaction.
Our research shows a considerable discrepancy among various types of news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets.
For instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures regarding business strategy, health sector and mergers
Our results show the results that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating how official reports should be structured and the topics that affect stock prices.
This paper addresses the financial markets problem space with particular emphasis on trading systems in banking today.
With the advent of modern computing, cross-regional trading transactions can now be executed within milliseconds, made possible by software advancements.
We then move on and discuss the trading system components and how it fits in with banks' different systems.
As for the humanoid robots the internal noise from moving parts severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy.
In this paper a new speech recognition system for robots is proposed in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features.
For this, we consider the bottleneck features, which have been successfully applied to deep neural network based speech recognition system.
we use motor data and sound features as inputs for the first neural network model
Then, a second neural network for sound modeling uses both the features from the first neural network and the sound features.
When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database the results show our method improved by 11% compared to others
Many techniques have been developed to help humanoid robots with household tasks, such as teleoperation, learning from demonstration and imitation.
sensor based robot control overcomes many of the difficulties of complex models and changing environments which limit the domain of application of the previous methods.
it's better to use sensors to understand how the robot interacts with its environment rather than telling it exactly where to move
Online social media let people share and discuss different opinions.
Simultaneously, they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to self-select the narratives they want to be exposed to, through both confirmation bias and personalized news feeds.
A clear understanding of trade-offs is still largely missing.
We introduce a stylized social learning model where most people update their beliefs based on new information, but a few people may reject information that goes against their existing views.
We show that this simple bias can generate strong opinion divide.
Furthermore the model results in states where unbiased agents act as if they were biased because their biased neighbors limit their access to information.

Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by keeping a mix of different ideas in a social group.
bias grows too strong accuracy declines as biased agents restrict information flow to subgroups
We explore how our model affects policy, highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.
The advent of the web changed the way we access information.
Recent studies showed that users tend to select information that is consistent with their system of beliefs, forming groups of people with similar views where dissenting information is ignored.
In this environment, users work together to create their shared story trying to show it's not working
Such a configuration occurs even in the consumption of news online, and considering that 63% of users access news directly form social media, one idea is that more polarization helps spread false information.
Along this path, we focus on user attitudes towards news sources on Facebook in different European countries Italy, France, Spain and Germany.
First we look at how people post on pages and interact with each other in different countries and observe different posting liking and commenting activities
Second, we explore how users interact with different pages and the formation of groups around certain topics
Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain.
Finally, we present a modified version of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate how users engage with and trust the news.
Our findings suggest that trust in information broadcaster plays a key role against polarization of users online.

In this paper, we discuss and compare the different approaches to decentralized resource management that are used by projects in the cryptocurrency space.
The introduced methods are then applied to design a decentralized exchange for cryptocurrencies as an example.
With the rise of Monero, a special type of cryptocurrency, mining in web browsers has become a viable option for mining.
Based on this technology a new form of online hacking widely called cryptojacking has gained momentum in the web A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to mine for cryptocurrencies
In this paper we systematically explore this phenomenon For this we propose a 3-phase analysis approach which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in a large number of websites
Cryptojacking is common.
Moreover, we perform several secondary analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape, including a look at the code to see its characteristics, an estimate of potential earnings from mining, and an evaluation of current security measures.
The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: self-executing programs on the blockchain.
Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance are commonly written in a high-level language like Solidity for Ethereum. contracts :[39],
Once deployed the bytecode is autonomously executed usually by a virtual machine
As with all programs, smart contracts can be vulnerable to attacks due to poor programming and tools, with buggy compilers.
At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency
Hence developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of looking at the code to detect potential security vulnerabilities.
In this paper, we present Vandal a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine code to logical relationships.
Users of the framework can express security analyses in a straightforward way: a security analysis is expressed in a special computer language called \souffle.
Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95% of all 141,000 contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming current state-of-the-art tools, including Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle, performed similarly.
As its popularity has grown, it has become a target for many threats.
Image tampering, made easier by digital tools, is causing problems regarding the authenticity of images.
As the most popular multimedia data, JPEG images can be easily tampered with without leaving any clues; therefore, image forensics, including detecting tampering and changes to the image, has become an active research topic in multimedia forensics.
Nevertheless, image tampering and its related operations by the quantization matrix has not been fully investigated.
Aiming to detect such forgery manipulations under the same quantization matrix, we propose a detection method by using shift-based features.
The learning classifiers are applied for classification.
Our results show that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and manipulations with the same matrix.
The tampering with computer clocks is a big challenge in computer forensics.
Finding these changes and reconstructing the actual timeline of events is of paramount importance
However this can be difficult since the attacker has several ways to hide such changes.
In particular, cloud computing, computer and server can be manipulated in various ways by an attacker.
Guest machines are especially vulnerable to attacks from their host.
It's also important Make the timeline accurate and detect changes. As such it is also important Make the timeline accurate and detect changes.
In this paper we look at issues with cloud computing and time accuracy in the cloud.
Further we describe a new design for detecting and correcting time errors in hosts and guests
it has been implemented on a simulator.
Performance figures show the feasibility of our proposal.
Detecting image edits is an important problem in image forensics.
It shows the history of how an image was processed, and also can expose forgeries present in an image.
There have been a few methods proposed to detect various image editing operations.
However, all operations must be known before the training phase.
But in real-scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image.
To solve this problem we propose a new AI-powered method which can make image changes.
The proposed method classifies image patches in a matching system as either similarly or differently processed using a special computer model.
The network can tell apart different types of image editing it can recognize new types of editing
The experimental results show the efficacy of the method in detecting vs discriminating different image editing operations.
Digital assistants are becoming more common in daily life. In interacting with these assistants, users may engage in multiple tasks within a short period of time.

As research has shown individuals suffer from diverse biases in decision-making.
We analyze the effects of decision-making biases of managers on organizational performance.
In the simulations, managerial decisions based on organizational complexity and incentives suffer from biases known from descriptive decision theory.
The results illustrate how biases together and in different contexts affect organizational performance.
We find that, contrary to intuition, some combinations of biases actually help performance while these biases negatively affect performance when they occur separately.
This might evoke considerations whether decision-making should be rational.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in changing environments.
Most robots, i.e., humanoids and other robots rely on planar regions.
For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over objects and need height information.
Considering obstacles that change introduces another level of complexity since they can lead to problems.
In this paper, we present a uses a system to find flat areas and detects dynamic obstacles.
Our system then uses this information to create maps in which paths can be planned quickly and efficiently.
We show in experiments that our framework runs quickly for one cycle and allows for 3D footstep planning.
A robot often first has to search for a user to do a task.
This is a challenging problem, especially when this person moves around since the robot’s field of view is constrained and the environment typically limits the user's view.
In this paper we propose a method that calculates how likely a user is to be seen at each possible location in the environment based on Monte Carlo simulations.
The robot takes into account the time it needs to reach the search locations and the visibility constraints when planning its search.
In this way, the robot can choose the next search location
Our experiments show that our method is faster than a common approach compared to a method that doesn't consider prior knowledge.
In many situations, users walk on typical paths between specific places where the robot is needed.
Depending on the environment, step-by-step following of the human might not be the optimal solution since better paths for the robot exist
We propose to perform a prediction about the human's future movements and use this information in a learning system to generate navigation actions for the robot.
Since frequent occlusions of the human will occur due to obstacles and the robot's constrained field of view the estimate about a person's position and the prediction of their next destination are impacted by uncertainty.
Our approach deals with such situations by considering things that block the human's view such that the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view.
We show that our technique shortens the path compared to following the user closely.
In this paper we introduce a way to help a robot move around in cluttered buildings.
We use detected objects to predict costs of potential obstacles.
By looking at the costs of its route, the robot is then able to navigate in a more informed manner and reduces the risk of getting stuck in busy areas.
The results show our method enables the robot to navigate through cluttered regions and achieves shorter completion times compared to a standard approach without prediction.
In this paper, we present an integrated navigation system that allows humanoid robots to navigate through unfamiliar, crowded spaces.
From a regular depth camera on the robot, our system estimates the robot's pose to compensate for drift of odometry and maintains a heightmap representation of the environment.

To check for collisions during planning, we developed a new approach that takes into account the robot's shape and the obstacles.
As we demonstrate in experiments with a Nao humanoid, our system enables the robot to navigate through cluttered spaces and the robot is able to traverse highly challenging passages.
In this paper, we present a new way to improve the movement model of a humanoid robot based on observations of its monocular camera.
Our technique estimates the parameters of the complete model, consisting of the joint angle offsets of the whole body including the legs, as well as the camera settings.
Furthermore, we developed a method to choose the best configurations for the calibration process that provides a good balance between accuracy and observations.
Our approach yields better optimization results compared to randomly chosen configurations.
Hence our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results
Our optimization is flexible and the implementation which is available online can easily be applied to different humanoids.

To develop group display applications a drone formation control is proposed.
Simulation shows that drone formation can display messages effectively
The rapid growth of the Internet and mobile devices has revamped our living styles and daily habits.
To ride on the digital trend, more businesses are now online.
Marketing and advertising is one of business areas that is transformed digitally.
The rise of influencers, social media, and multi-channel retailing have attracted countless business entities to consider the adoption of marketing tools for promoting their products.
They should be chosen carefully.
In this paper a fuzzy decision-making approach is proposed and developed for assisting industry practitioners in evaluate and select the right digital marketing tools for adoption.
A new way makes choosing marketing tools more efficient but it also increases the practitioner's ability to achieve marketing goals

Big data, the ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data in tremendous speed and with negligible costs, delivers immense benefits in marketing efficiency, healthcare, environmental protection, national security and more.
The central tenets of the current privacy framework, the principles of minimizing data and limiting its use, are severely strained by the big data technological and business reality.

The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding ethics around data, such as privacy and fairness.
The machine may exacerbate, enable, or simply draw attention to the ethical challenges, but it is humans who are responsible.
Policymakers should seek to devise agreed-upon guidelines for data analysis and profiling.
Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; criteria for calling out unethical if not illegal behavior; types of privacy risks; and giving people clear access to their data.
As voice speakers permeate continuously in the world, more and more people will gradually get used to voice interaction.
Speech recognition and natural language processing have improved over the past few years but users still may encounter errors like "cannot understand" or "no requested audio resource".
When an error message is reported, it is vital that the smart speaker gives a good response.
Currently the response strategies adopted by leading smart speaker brands in China differed on two dimensions: "apology or not" and "humor or neutral"
We explored user preference of response strategies under two error scenarios: cannot understand and no requested audio resource
Two key factors how people feel and how sincere we are were measured.
The results showed that participants were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when the speaker apologized in two types of errors.
In the “no audio requested” scenario, humor had no significant impact on how people feel satisfied and sincere.
But in the when people can't understand scenario humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity
smart speakers can't distinguish human voice from machine voice
a method to identify whether a human or a machine is sending the voice commands to a smart speaker is desired
to prevent unauthorized voice commands when no one is home, we propose a device with a microphone to detect a human nearby, supposing it can be incorporated in a smart speaker in the future.
Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups however these existing voice assistants support limited language options for both English and non-English speakers.
we conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants from different English backgrounds to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker
The findings show that compared to others the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device
It also shows that language skills affect how users interact with voice user interfaces.
The findings from this study can create insights for voice recognition experts in VUIs for people in different parts of the world.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process (specifically, drug molecules, compounds in high-throughput screening libraries, combinatorial chemistry blocks and nondrug molecules)
Significant differences were observed between the drug properties obtained for the drug molecules and those obtained for the screening compounds, which appear to be closely related to the non-drug characteristics.
It is suggested that pharmacophores can be used to improve the selection of compounds for drug development, thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects.
Describing lab experiments in a way that computers can understand is a way to make experiment descriptions machine-readable.
Protocols are communicated using concise scientific English, which precludes translate by software algorithms.
Given the availability of a suitable ontology some or all of the pertinent information can be captured by asserting a few facts expressed as a set of statements.
With appropriate annotation, assays can be searched, analyzed and evaluated in various ways, analogous to other segments of drug discovery informatics.
The BioAssay Ontology has been designed for this purpose, and provides a structure for terms that can be linked.
This produces a huge amount of data from many samples.
Further computer analysis is typically done with the help of open source tools, where each application performs a single step.
This situation leaves the bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools and manage the data, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.
A statistical software was used to mine the relationships between causes of illness and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Medical patterns and TCM, Symptoms and TCM.

A statistical method for determining the genetic makeup of mixed bacterial samples, known as the GPA system has reduced the error rate in identifying genetic variations.
CRISPR is a tool that is widely used for gene editing.
However side effects may occur as a result of lasting enzyme activity
Anti-CRISPR proteins, which are powerful molecules that inhibit the CRISPR system, may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR system in gene editing.
Additionally more in-depth research on these proteins would help researchers to better understand the evolution of bacteria and their viruses
Therefore it is necessary to collect and integrate data on different kinds of CRISPR inhibitors
The CRISPR/Cas9 system was recently developed as a powerful and flexible technology for targeted genome engineering, including genome editing and gene regulation.
These applications require the design of efficient and specific guide RNAs.
this remains challenging as it requires many factors
CRISPR has become a hot research area ever since its advent for its efficiency in editing DNA sequences.
Based on its function, a variety of techniques have been developed to achieve different aims.
The target locations of a DNA strain can be broken and fixed, during which the genes can be removed, repaired, silenced, or activated.
The high efficiency of CRISPR preparation and the ease of conducting experiments make it now a powerful tool of high-content screen.
Gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care.
Improving the health of future generations might improve the health of individuals and communities and be seen as a public good.

Remarkably the necessary involvement of women in a better situation has not been discussed by its proponents.
This implies that women might be morally required to use IVF to have children.
Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless a new way to carry babies is invented.
These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective.
Despite the lack of a clear agreement on whether human genome modification is a good idea, there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
The CRISPR system has been successfully applied in genome editing.
However the efficiency of the CRISPR system varies depending on the type of gRNA used
Using machine learning model, a model was created to predict its effectiveness for any given gRNAs

A key problem for autonomous car navigation is the understanding at a detailed level of the current driving situation.
Addressing this issue requires the extraction of meaningful information from on-board stereo imagery by classifying the fundamental elements of urban scenes into meaningful categories that can be easily understood (streets, buildings, pedestrians, vehicles, signs, etc.)
A random method is proposed to fuse a 3D map data with stereo imagery classification.
A novel fusion architecture based on the Stixel framework is presented for combining image details with a special kind of neural network with depth information obtained from stereo imagery while integrating coarse prior depth and label information.
The proposed approach was tested on a data set in urban environments.
The results show that the classification accuracy of the urban features was significantly enhanced by this method compared to what is obtained from the semantic pixel-wise segmentation of a CNN alone.
In recent years self-driving cars are becoming more common on roads, with the promise of bringing safety and efficiency to modern transportation systems.
Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on realistic simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle.
It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that driverless cars are assessed against a wide range of realistic driving scenarios.

In this paper we propose to automate the process using machine learning to create challenging self-driving scenarios that test self-driving systems, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.
We show that by incorporating the generated scenarios into the training set of the self-driving policy, and by adjusting the self-driving system using visual learning we obtain safer self-driving behavior.
With the development of self-driving technology, more and more L3 driverless vehicles are launched in market, people get opportunities to experience the self-driving cars in their daily life.
As a result, there is a growing demand for the autopilot experience.
Human-computer interaction can not only improve the driving experience, but also accelerate the process of self-driving commercialization.
This paper discusses eye-movement interaction, voice interaction and gesture interaction in self-driving car, and analyzes the technology, advantages and disadvantages of the existing interaction modes, and prospect the future development trend of human-machine interaction.
Self-driving vehicle technologies are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation.
One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe working together with other vehicles and sharing data.
When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same space at the same time, they might collide with one another, might become deadlocked, or might slam on the brakes making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers in a self-driving vehicle.
In this paper, we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points, where two lanes merge.
We present a safe protocol for merge points named Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points, where self-driving vehicles use a combination of their own sensors and messages from other vehicles.
Our data shows that our traffic protocol performs better compared to simple traffic protocols while ensuring safety.
Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the concept and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles.
These vehicles are increasingly relying on vehicle networks.
New technologies for connected vehicles bring new risks to self-driving cars.
These communication systems render driverless cars vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), cyber attacks that disrupt traffic.
In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and regular cars.
The hybrid detection system relies on neural networks to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS)
The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving vehicles.
This paper proposes a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for a self-driving system using ROS
One approach to developing self-driving cars uses a software tool called ROS, which helps build applications for robots.
the popular approach in the automotive industry is the use of Simulink for modeling, simulating and analyzing

It is not been fully used in self-driving systems yet due to a lack of data and difficulty in collaboration.
we provide a Software testing tools for Self-driving cars called Self-driving car technology

The provided benchmark contains MATLAB/Simulink samples available in Autonomous driving software.
They help to design self-driving car systems using MATLAB/Simulink.
self-driving cars need to be tested safely
testing self-driving cars in regular traffic is a common but costly and risky method which has already caused fatalities
As a safer option virtual tests in which self-driving car software is tested in computer simulations have been proposed.
It's not possible to test all scenarios for self-driving cars through manual testing.
Therefore, we developed AsFault, a tool for creating virtual tests for self-driving cars.
We test AsFault by testing the lane keeping feature of a self-driving car, for which AsFault generates scenarios that cause it to drive off the road.
A video illustrating AsFault in action is available at a YouTube video
As self-driving vehicles are introduced, little is known about how potential users perceive them.
This is especially true for self-driving vehicles deployed in public transport services.
In this study, the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus is assessed compared to a trip with a regular bus, based on surveys to see what people prefer.
Based on the responses of 282 people from the Netherlands and Germany, a model that looks at people's attitudes towards self-driving cars and their interest in technology.
public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus for short trips
This is due to the finding that the time it takes to travel is twice as long for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus for a short trip.
Findings from this study further suggest that the presence of a human driver on self-driving buses makes them less popular, or if they are operated as a fixed route service.
Those who like technology or trust self-driving cars perceive the self-driving busses better than others.
Preferences towards automated public transport services are expected to evolve along with the transition from pilots to everyday use.
The management of self-driving cars is becoming more complex as the development of self-driving technology progresses.
One approach to self-driving systems is the use of ROS however the system used in the automotive industry is typically designed using MATLAB/Simulink which can simulate and evaluate the models used for self-driving.
These models are incompatible with ROS-based systems.
Working together it is necessary to rewrite the C++ code and incorporate them into the ROS-based system which makes development inefficient.
Therefore the proposed framework allows software created using a popular programming tool to be used in a ROS-based self-driving system thereby improving development efficiency.
Furthermore, our tests demonstrated its practical potential.
Online Social Networks OSNs have become more popular for sharing information among users
News about emergency events often spreads quickly in social networks, and so does misinformation about the event.
any false or inaccurate information
We study the problem of misinformation identification in social networks, and we focus in particular on the Twitter social network.

Our research on 80,000 tweets and 60,000 users shows that our approach helps spot misinformation during emergencies.
Furthermore our model manages to identify misinformation a feature that can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation
Superintelligence is a type of future artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans.
If built, superintelligence could have a major impact, with both good and bad effects.
Meanwhile the ongoing discussion is the subject of the idea of super smart machines which includes a lot of false information

This paper surveys strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation
Two types of strategies are examined: strategies to prevent spreading misinformation and strategies to fix it after it spreads.
In general misinformation can be difficult to correct suggesting a good number of ways to prevent it
The strategies proposed can be applied to lay public attention to advanced artificial intelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus.
The online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages.
The misinformation campaign aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns.
Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when multiple cascades are allowed.
First we provide a formal model for this process and introduce an important concept called priority.
Second, we show that the misinformation problem cannot be solved quickly unless a complex computer problem (NP) is also solvable quickly.
We introduce several types of priorities.
Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation problem.
The effectiveness of the proposed method is supported by encouraging experimental results.
Wrong information, in the field of library and info science, is often regarded as a problem that needs to be corrected or simply understood as either misinformation or disinformation without further consideration.
Misinformation and disinformation, however, may cause significant problems for users in online environments, where they are constantly exposed to a lot of false or misleading information.
This paper aims to establish conceptual groundwork for future research by examining the relationships between information, false information, and misleading information.
Our analysis extends to a discussion of ways to identify lies and false information.
We argue that misinformation and disinformation are related and distinct.
Misinformation is more than just being inaccurate or incomplete, disinformation is not always the same as misinformation.
The growth of social media provides a way for people to communicate, but at the same time it becomes a hotbed of misinformation.
The spread of misinformation over social media is injurious to public interest.
We design a framework, which integrates human intelligence working together and machine intelligence, to help identify misinformation.
Identify the expertise of users based on what they post online; and match the experts with given suspected misinformation.
send the suspicious information to the right people we can collect the assessments of experts to judge the credibility of information and help refute misinformation
We focus on expert finding.
We propose a method to index microblog users.
Experiments on real-world data show that our method is effective in identifying experts on social media.
The importance of research on false information has received wide recognition.
Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of theoretical models and the scarcity of misinformation in support of such research.
This paper aims to address the challenges by understanding misinformation and the interoperability of misinformation.
In particular, a model of misinformation is proposed through analyzing and summarizing previous research.
The supported misinformation model can not only guide future misinformation research but also lay the foundation for building a digital misinformation library by studying misinformation and by sharing and managing misinformation.
In addition, we present a clear approach for managing misinformation in a digital library, and suggest future research directions related to the misinformation model.
Conspiracy theories have gained a lot of attention lately, due to their impact on society.
However little is known about how conspiracy theories spread on social media.
We present a qualitative study of conspiracy theorizing on Reddit during a recent health crisis


Practical implications for health professionals and experts are discussed.
Conspiracy theories are common in online discussions.
Conspiracy theories spread and become more complex, further complicating efforts to understand them and to limit their propagation.
It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to study conspiracy theories in online communities.
What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online What are the recurring elements in their discussions What do these elements tell us about the way users think This work answers these questions by examining years of discussions on the Reddit community for conspiracy theories
We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory the conspiratorial agents the actions they perform and their targets.
For example, a type of pattern such as 'government controls communication' represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements denote how governmental agencies control information.
Thus, similar patterns appear in many conspiracy theories.
In the process, these representations help us understand how users discuss conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about.
Our approach enables a large study of conspiracy theories in social media and other news with implications for stopping their spread.
Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues that belief in conspiracy theories is understandable at least in some cases if we consider the evidence we judge each conspiracy theory on its own merits and belief in such theories is found to be true in many cases
I examine the evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories. The problems with this evidence are not unique to such theories.
There is a problem with the conspiracy theorist's use of evidence, it is one of principle: is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error I argue that there is no case for scepticism of conspiracy theories based purely on their use of evidence.
Cryptocurrency is a rapid financial innovation which has attracted a large number of people around the world.
The high-speed evolution, large price swings in cryptocurrency, and different countries have different attitudes towards money have triggered panic and chain reactions towards the application and adoption of cryptocurrency and have caused public security related events.
In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and risks of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history.
Furthermore as people see it our analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable.
Blockchain technology is the technology behind it developed for Bitcoin's most popular type
Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular with the potential to become a powerful force.
Individuals and organizations may benefit from blockchain with its ability to make that transaction simpler and easier between entities, and to facilitate safe data sharing.
We investigate factors that influence a person's intention to use a blockchain cryptocurrency.
We develop a model of cryptocurrency adoption based on a known theory to: identify the determinants for the acceptance of cryptocurrency and explore the relative importance of each construct.
We offer real-life evidence for a better understanding of cryptocurrency adoption with practical implications in an e-government context.
Cryptocurrency was initially created as a digital currency, then various derivatives were created for financial transactions and other purposes.
This paper aims to offer insights to help understand cryptocurrency by treating it as a financial asset.
We position cryptocurrency by comparing its features with two traditional and massively adopted financial assets foreign exchange and stock.
Our investigation suggests that the behavior of cryptocurrency is like that of the stock market.
As to the robustness and clustering structure our analysis shows the cryptocurrency market is riskier than the stock market it is currently a high-risk market

At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a significant type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion.
It is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices.
Considering the poor financial services and infrastructure in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive.
The high storage cost and long payment processing times are the main obstacles for mobile payments using cryptocurrency.
We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment one involves a bank the other one does not require any centralized party
We also provide a solution for the bank to meet customer identity checks and anti-money laundering regulations when it is involved in mobile payment processing.
Motivated by recent financial crises, research has focused on how financial problems spread and influence each other in the market.
Financial news affects financial markets.
We propose a measure of how news articles on the web relate to each other. It can be used to predict financial risks.
We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the relationship between financial markets and news.
We believe that strong ties in financial news reflect market movements.
Cohesiveness is a measure of general risk than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms.
Our results indicate that financial news is highly correlated with and driven by volatility on the financial markets.
In this paper, I propose a methodology to study the relationship between entropy and financial markets.

I study how a change in the system in the United States affects the entropy in the other markets.
I model the entropy using a dynamic factor model and derive a common factor behind the entropy movements in these four markets.
Mobile devices are common in daily life.
Nowadays such devices come with features of desktop computers
People can use these devices for various purposes.
These devices are very easy to use and accepted widely, there are chances that these devices can be used for illegal activities.
The percentage of mobile phones or smart phones is on the rise involved in cyber crimes.
It becomes necessary to analyze such devices.
This paper discusses different types of digital evidence present in Microsoft’s Windows Mobile smart phones and a software-based method for safely retrieving the data.
Also it describes a tool developed for looking at devices.

These devices produced by many different manufacturers often posses limited standard ways to connect, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces.
With a growing focus on protecting user data, encryption is now common in many consumer devices, including IoT devices.
Under these circumstances a significant challenge is presented to digital forensics investigation where data from IoT devices needs to be analysed
This work explores the EM analysis literature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT devices.
EM side-channel analysis is a technique where unintentional radiation is used for eavesdropping on the operations and data handling of computing devices.
The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks require no modification to the device.
The literature on various types of EM attack methods are discussed – selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device investigation scenarios.

The use of mobile phone forensics to look into suspicious activities is nothing new.
Mobile phones have evolved into smartphones and fraudsters have evolved with them.
Smartphones are equipped with features that can be used for data theft or contacting others without the company's knowledge - none of which passes through company-owned systems, and is to all intents and purposes 'off the grid'.
Employers should be aware of the risks when devices are given out, and making sure processes are in place if suspicions arise, explains Philip Ridley of CCL-Forensics.
Detecting corporate fraudsters is a challenge.
It's not only about playing catch-up with the intellect, motives and awareness of the e-fraudster, but also the e-fraudster and other technologies that can be misused
What's more the methods through which the technology can be used to hide and prevent fraudulent activities away from corporate networks that can be monitored and detected are constantly evolving
This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or just theft.
Phishers continue to change the look of websites they hack to make them look like real websites. They continue to avoid detection by phishing countermeasures.
Manipulations can be similar to small code changes or adding/removing major details.
To appropriately respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, a cadre of file matching algorithms is implemented to detect phishing websites based on their content, using a custom database of over 17,000 phishing attacks on 159 different brands.
The results of the experiments using various content-based approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
The focus of the early post-exercise period (i.e., 1–8 h) is to enhance physiological processes that are critical for reversing the exercise-induced disturbances to the body's balance and functions and for promoting adaptations to training [1].
Recommended nutritional strategies to maximize recovery include protein for enhancing rates of protein synthesis and carbohydrates for replenishing glycogen stores.

The ingestion of 20-25 grams of high-quality protein after exercise is shown to help rebuild muscle.
The cultural environment surrounding some sports often involves the intake of large amounts of alcohol after training and competition, with athletes in several team sports being particularly at risk of binge drinking.
The outcomes of drinking too much after exercise are likely to include how exercise and drinking affect the body.
Although the concurrent consumption of carbohydrate can partially offset the deleterious effects of alcohol intake on post-exercise glycogen resynthesis, the effect of alcohol consumption on muscle protein synthesis is unknown. Drinking carbs after exercise can reduce the negative effects of alcohol on the body's energy storage.

We thought that drinking after exercise would decrease the rate at which muscles build new protein.
Eight healthy physically active male subjects (age 21.4±4.8 yr, body mass 79.3 kg, peak oxygen uptake 48.1 mL/kg/min, leg extension one rep max 104 kg; values are mean ± SD) who had been participating in regular exercise (3 times wk−1 for >6 months) volunteered for this study.
The study employed a randomized counter-balanced, cross-over design in which each subject completed bouts of consecutive resistance and high-intensity exercise, alternating between continuous and intermittent efforts with post-exercise ingestion of alcohol-carbohydrate (ALC-CHO), alcohol-protein (ALC-PRO) or protein only (PRO) beverages on three separate occasions.
Resistance exercise consisted of eight sets of five repetitions at 80% of 1RM.
After completion of the final set, subjects rested for 5 min before commencing 30 min of continuous cycling at about 63% of their maximum power output (VO2peak).
Upon completion, subjects rested on the bike for 2 min before undertaking 10×30 s high intensity intervals at 110% of maximum power output, with 30 s active recovery (∼50% PPO) between each work bout.
After exercise, subjects rested for 4 hours, subjects ingested a 500 mL solution of either protein (25 g whey protein powder; ISO8, Musashi, Melbourne, VIC Australia) or an energy-match in the form of CHO (25 g maltodextrin, International Health Investments, Helensvale, QLD Australia)
Furthermore, a meal containing 1.5 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body mass was consumed ∼2 h post-exercise, immediately after the muscle biopsy, according to recommendations for post-exercise glycogen recovery [24].
The 8 h time frame represents an important phase of recovery as well as the period during which blood alcohol levels may still be high due to a recent drinking binge
The alcohol ingestion protocol 1.5 grams per kilogram of body mass; 12 drinks ± 2 began 1 h post-exercise and was consumed in 6 equal volumes of 1 part vodka (∼60 mL) to four parts orange juice (∼240 mL, 1.8 g CHO·kg−1 BM) during a 3 h period.
For the PRO condition, orange juice was consumed with a matched volume of water in place of the alcohol.
Subjects ingested the beverages every 30 minutes.
Blood cell signaling and mRNA data were analyzed. Myofibrillar protein synthesis was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with repeated measures.
The first novel finding of this study was that mTOR signaling and rates of muscle protein synthesis following continuous and varied high-intensity exercise, designed to the metabolic profile of team sports, were impaired during the early (8 h) recovery phase by the ingestion of large amounts (1.5 g•kg−1 BM) of alcohol.
These outcomes were most evident (37% reduction in rates of MPS) when alcohol was consumed in the absence of protein intake after exercise, as is likely to occur when intoxication reduces the athlete's compliance to sound recovery practices.
However a second finding was that even when protein was consumed in amounts that were proven to be effective after exercise the intake of alcohol reduced the muscle-building process by approximately 24% representing only a partial 'rescue' of the anabolic response compared with protein alone
mTORC1 is a central node for integrating nutrients and exercise signals [31], [32].
In conclusion the current data provide the new finding that alcohol impairs the response of muscle recovery in muscle tissue despite optimal nutrient provision.
How much alcohol was consumed in this study was based on amounts reported during heavy drinking.
However published reports suggest intakes of some individuals can be significantly greater [9] [50] which is of concern for various health and safety concerns [13]
It's hard to find clear advice on drinking and sports performance that athletes can relate to.
Given the need to promote protein synthesis that helps repair and grow muscle the results of the current study provide clear evidence of impaired recovery when alcohol is consumed after concurrent exercise (resistance and high-intensity) even in the presence of optimal nutritional conditions.
We propose our data is of interest to athletes and coaches.
Our findings provide that moderate alcohol intake helps recovery after exercise with the potential to affect current sports and athletes.
In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955 There is little research showing that muscle growth from exercise directly improves strength.
To this day, long-term strength improvements are mainly due to changes in muscle size.
Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for gaining muscle size and strength.
However the conclusion that muscle size affects strength is surprising given the limited evidence
We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: \nthere is a weak link between muscle size and strength gained from training; \nthe loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; \nmuscle growth is similar for low- and high-load training, but strength results are different.
Low-intensity occlusion training provides a unique beneficial training mode for promoting muscle growth.
Training at low intensity with some blood flow restriction results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as 3 weeks.
A typical exercise prescription calls for 3 to 5 sets with short rest periods.
The buildup of metabolic products causes physiological effects, specifically a rise in growth hormone higher than usual levels.
Occlusion training is applicable for people with joint pain.
Exercise doesn't significantly increase muscle size.
We and others have demonstrated that Exercise changes how the body uses protein and builds muscle over time.
These findings promote a challenge to the current understanding by providing a new look on muscle mass regulation and insight into exercise-countermeasures for populations prone to muscle loss.
Stretching is used to move joints more easily and prevent injuries.
Some research indicates that stretch training may induce muscle hypertrophy
The purpose of this review was to evaluate stretch training for muscle growth in humans.
Of 10 studies, 3 found positive effects of stretch training on muscle strength.
Intriguingly the stretching was carried out with an apparatus or with an external load
Of the 5 studies that integrated stretching into a resistance training program, 2 applied the stretching in the rest period and showed enhanced muscle growth.
In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to confer beneficial changes in muscle size and architecture; alternatively, when stretching is done with some strain, it may lead to muscle growth.
Cycle training is widely performed as a major part of any exercise program to improve cardiovascular health.
However the effect of cycle training on muscle size and strength gain still requires further insight even though professional cyclists have bigger muscles compared to others
The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycle training on muscle size and strength of the lower extremity and how it increases muscle size.
It is plausible that cycle training may take longer to increase muscle size compared to regular weight training.
Cycle training induces muscle hypertrophy similarly between young and older age groups, while strength gain seems to favor older adults, it seems that older adults have a greater chance of improving muscle quality.
For young adults more intense cycling is needed to build strength.
It also appears that muscle increase induced by exercise results from strong muscles.
Resistance training is the best way to increase muscle mass.
It has also been shown to promote health benefits.
Although it is deemed safe and of clinical relevance for treating and preventing a large number of diseases, a time-efficient and minimal dose of exercise has been the focus of a great number of research studies.
Similarly a U-shaped relationship between training dose/volume and physiological response has been hypothesized to exist.
The majority of the evidence supports a dose-response relationship between resistance training volume and muscle hypertrophy and health outcomes.
Additionally, there is a paucity of data to support the U-shaped curve.
The main idea argued herein is that volume is the easiest variable to change that has the strongest evidence-based response with important repercussions be these muscle hypertrophy or health-related outcomes.
The effects of short versus long rest intervals in resistance training on muscle hypertrophy have been investigated. The findings are equivocal and the implications unclear.
Both short and long rest intervals may be useful when training for muscle hypertrophy.
Novel findings involving trained participants using measures to detect changes in muscle hypertrophy suggest a possible advantage for the use of long rest intervals to cause muscle growth.
However due to a lack of similar studies further research is needed to give a clear picture between these two approaches.
Memory is a process in which information is stored and retrieved.
For vertebrates it occurs only in the brain.
This review describes a memory in muscles that helps them remember how to grow such that a fibre that has previously been large but subsequently lost its mass can regain mass faster than new muscles This process helps muscles regain their mass faster if they've grown before
A new cell biological model can explain this phenomenon.
new, unexercised muscle fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth.
Even if subjected to significant muscle loss, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue.
Fibres with more muscle nuclei grow faster when exercised, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength.
This memory might be very long lasting in humans.
Muscle nuclei are harder to recruit in older people, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice.
Eating small frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance.
Several observational studies lend support to this hypothesis, with an inverse relationship between eating and body fat.
The purpose of this narrative review is to present and discuss an analysis of combined data that evaluated experimental research on meal frequency with respect to changes in fat mass and lean mass.
Feeding frequency was associated with reductions in fat mass and body fat as well as an increase in muscle mass.
However the study's positive results were likely due to one study alone raising doubts about whether eating more often helps with body composition
In conclusion, although the initial results show a possible benefit of eating more often for better health, the results show that eating more often may be good for your body, these findings should be carefully considered.
Inactive adults experience a 5% loss of muscle mass per decade accompanied by resting metabolic rate reduction and fat accumulation.
Resisting muscle training adds lean weight and burns fat.
Benefits of resistance training include improved physical performance, balance, walking speed, functional independence, cognitive abilities, and self-esteem.
Resistance training may assist prevention and management of type 2 diabetes by decreasing visceral fat, reducing HbA1c, increasing glucose transporter type 4 density, and improving insulin sensitivity.
Resistance training may enhance cardiovascular health, by lowering blood pressure, lowering bad cholesterol, and increasing good cholesterol.
Resistance training may promote bone development with studies showing density increases
Resistance training may be effective for reducing low back pain and easing discomfort associated with arthritis and fibromyalgia and has been shown to reverse specific aging factors in skeletal muscle.
Physical activity has proved to be a way to prevent many diseases and improves general health.
Common sense advices call for starting intense training later, strength training-related activities, which are usually postponed at the end of the growth age, even among sport practitioners.
However such advices seem to have a mainly anecdotal nature
Current research does not discourage strength training for kids and teenagers, provided that safety guidelines are followed, such as getting a doctor's approval and proper training.
At the same time, several studies provide consistent findings supporting the benefits of regular exercise in young subjects.
Improved motor skills and body composition, in terms of muscle and bone health, have been extensively documented, especially if sport practice began early, when they were teenagers.
Strength training is a safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents.
Human aging results in a range of changes to skeletal muscle.
Age-related muscle loss is one of the main contributors to musculoskeletal impairments in the elderly.
Resistance training can attenuate muscle weakness in older adults, however few articles have focused on the effects of resistance training on functional mobility.
The purpose of this review of existing research was to 1) present the current state of literature regarding the effects of resistance training on functional mobility outcomes for older adults with muscle weakness and 2) provide clinicians with practical guidelines that can be used with seniors during resistance training or to encourage exercise.
We set forth evidence that resistance training can attenuate age-related changes in physical changes that come with age, including improvements in walking speed and balance, and fall risk reduction.
Older adults should participate in exercise, and move towards a more active lifestyle.
Maximizing muscle growth from weightlifting is best achieved by adjusting the workout plan, including what exercises to do, how to arrange them, and how long to rest between sets.
An often overlooked variable that impacts muscle growth is repetition duration.
Duration amounts to the total of the main, side, and balance components of a repetition, and is based on the tempo of the repetition.
We conducted a systematic review and data analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT.
Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations from 0.5 to 8 seconds.
From a practical standpoint it would seem that a moderate range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth.
Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a muscle-building perspective, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.
Recovery from exercise refers to the time it takes to recover after exercise
It also refers to various physical processes that occur after exercise that are distinct from the physiology of either the exercising or the resting states.
Recovery of the cardiovascular system after exercise occurs over a short period, during which many characteristics of the system change over time.
Some of these changes may be necessary for long-term adaptation to exercise training yet some can lead to heart problems during recovery.
Furthermore, some of these changes may provide insight into when the cardiovascular system has recovered from prior training and is prepared for more training stress.
This review focuses on the most consistently observed hemodynamic adjustments and the factors that help the heart recover and will highlight how they differ following resistance and aerobic exercise.
Primary emphasis will be placed on the hypotensive effect of aerobic and resistance exercise and associated mechanisms that can lead to symptoms of low blood pressure and dizziness if not treated.
Finally, we focus on the practical application of this information to strategies to maximize the benefits of heart recovery, or avoid its weaknesses.
We will explore appropriate field measures and discuss to what extent these can guide the athlete's training.
Exercise and physical activity are increasingly becoming key tools in the treatment and prevention of several medical conditions including arthritis and diabetes; this notion has been termed exercise as medicine.
Exercise has favorable effects on reducing heart problems, inflammation, and high blood pressure, in addition to increasing physical functioning, strength, and cardio-respiratory capacity.
Chronic kidney disease is often overlooked as a target for exercise-based therapy.
Despite the range of kidney disease, kidney disease stages (dialysis and transplant), exercise has a potential role in all patients suffering from the condition.
In this review, we summarise the important role exercise may have in the clinical management of kidney disease and how this treatment should be best administered and 'prescribed'.
Blood flow restriction is used to increase strength in healthy individuals.
Its effects on pain and function in knee pain are unknown.
To see if adding BFR helps with knee pain.
Methods: Review of studies with data analysis.
Randomized clinical trials that compared resistance exercise with or without BFR to treat knee pain in individuals with knee pain were included.
Adding BFR to exercises doesn't make a big difference in reducing pain or improving knee function
There were 43 million patients with hypertension in Japan.
The management of this condition is given the highest priority. The importance of lifestyle changes for the prevention and treatment of hypertension has been recognized in Japan.
In particular, emphasis has been placed on increasing daily activity and physical exercise (sports).
In this literature review we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions (e.g., type, intensity, and duration) for the prevention and treatment of hypertension as described in Japanese and foreign articles.
This review recommends safe and effective whole-body aerobic exercise at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-65% of maximum heart rate, 30 minutes per session, 3-4 times a week) that primarily focuses on the major muscle groups for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.
Resistance exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise, but resistance exercise is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure who have chest symptoms.
recently there has been a renewed public interest in This technology
Given the importance of nutrition for athletes, there is a concern about the effects of IFast on athletes.
Looking at high-intensity endurance and resistance exercises, studies have been varied but are uniform in showing that there is no benefit to athletic performance while fasting.
Every person encounters periods in which the time for exercise is limited.
During such periods the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain rather than improve physical fitness.
certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods
In general populations endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33–66% as low as 13–26 minutes per session as long as exercise intensity is maintained
Strength and muscle size at least in younger populations can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with as little as 1 session of strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity relative load is maintained; whereas, in older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 sessions per week and 2–3 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity.
Our primary conclusion is that exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time, despite significant reductions in exercise.
Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients, mainly protein and carbs, in and around an exercise session.
Some have claimed that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition.
It has been suggested that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients.
The post-exercise period is the most critical part of nutrient timing.
Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only rebuilds muscle tissue and replenishes energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance.
Several researchers have made reference to an optimal training window whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize muscular adaptations.
However the importance of a post-exercise window can vary
nutrient timing research is unclear and may not be applicable but recent evidence has directly challenged the classical view of the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake with respect to anabolism
Lack of time is a common barrier to exercise.
The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by evaluating research on training variables, techniques, and warm-up/stretching.

Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights based on training goals, availability and personal preferences.
Weekly training volume is more important than training frequency and we recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a 4-12 rep range
Advanced training techniques, such as special training methods roughly halves training time compared to traditional training, while maintaining training volume.
However, these methods are probably better at building muscle mass than muscular strength and more research is needed on long-term effects.
Finally, we advise restricting the warm-up to specific warm-ups for the exercise, and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.
Training frequency is considered an important variable in the muscle growth response to regimented resistance exercise.
The purpose of this paper was to conduct a review of existing studies and analysis of experimental studies designed to investigate the effects of weekly training frequency on muscle growth.
Results showed no difference.
Study comparison of non-standard research showed a significant effect favoring higher frequencies, although the overall difference in magnitude of effect between frequencies of 1 and 3+ days per week was modest.
There is evidence that how often you do resistance training does not affect muscle growth.
for a given volume individuals can choose a weekly frequency per muscle groups based on personal preference
Many different training techniques have been advocated as a means to heighten muscle growth.
Weightlifting techniques like drop sets supersets and heavy negatives particularly have been shown to help the hypertrophic response to exercise.
This article will explore how these techniques can help build muscle and improve weightlifting programs.
The quest to increase lean body mass is pursued by weightlifters.
Research is lacking however for maximizing muscle growth through exercise
Bodybuilders generally train with light to medium weights and short rest intervals that induce high amounts of metabolic stress.
Powerlifters, on the other hand, routinely train with heavy loads and lengthy rest periods between sets.
Both groups are known to get very muscular, but it's unclear which method works best.
It has been shown that many factors mediate muscle growth process and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in muscle growth after exercise.
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to study how exercise affects muscle growth and (b) to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal protocol for maximizing muscle growth.
New mobile technology can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles.
This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a tool that complements the AEGIS platform for preventing and managing wildfires.
Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, search for nearby facilities and access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.).
An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of tasks by Cortana, a digital assistant that allows voice commands.

Mobile technologies have been used in education. Examples include a personal digital assistant and e-books.
Some of the mobile carriers uses technology that senses its surroundings to improve wireless connections to use technology and learning together effectively, and then provide students with new learning experiences that are different from the past learning.
Considering the use of mobile technology in education, previous studies have shown that mobile learning can improve learning by enhancing interaction and achieving its goals.
In the main stream of mobile learning, with suitable learning methods in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning outcomes and attitude of elementary school students on a school garden project when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies.

Participants typed on a computer screen into a digital assistant using a stylus and one of these two keyboards.
We introduced a new method for measuring how fast people type
We introduced a new measuring technique for measuring transcription rate that provides a composite measure of speed and accuracy.
Using this technique, we calculated the maximum transcription rate for each keyboard
Transcription rates were higher for the QWERTY keyboard than the T9, even though the T9 has better physical design.
The results show that transcription rates were higher for the QWERTY keyboard than for the T9, despite the T9 keyboard's better design
An ancillary experiment demonstrated that the poorer performance of the T9 layout may have resulted from an increase in visual scanning time due to visual arrangement of the letters on the keys.
A side experiment showed that the T9 layout performed poorly because it took longer to look at the keys due to how the letters were arranged.
Together these findings imply that the QWERTY keyboard layout remains the most effective of the available designs for tapping on touch screens.
the QWERTY keyboard layout remains the most effective

Little is known about new mobile applications.
Research in the study of technology suggests that the evolution of new applications is a process of interaction between different groups aiming to create a common definition of mobile technology problems and solutions that becomes clear only later.
This theory is illustrated by the development of personal digital assistants.

In the environment, mobile terminals like personal digital assistant or cellular phone are used to access the Web.
We did the setup in a special viewer system that transforms Web content into passive viewing content that is especially useful for mobile devices.
A system for extracting images and text from Web content generates a Macromedia Flash file, which is a popular multimedia format.
The presentation of Web content depends on the type of device the Web interface of mobile terminals is designed almost the same as that of personal computers
However, comparing mobile and desktop terminals, device characteristics like screen resolution and sound quality affect the presentation on the terminal.
Moreover, when changing the display style, the presentation needs to be adjusted for the type of device because the missing information is often overlooked after changing the display.
To adjust the playout of Web content to the terminal type, we developed a method for visual presentation.
We represent the emotional aspect of a Web page by adjusting the background color of the screen.
Second, we emphasize the subject of the content by the logotype of the keyword.
Third, we break the image into parts and present one after another using visual effects.
These procedures can be applied to any type of terminal.
