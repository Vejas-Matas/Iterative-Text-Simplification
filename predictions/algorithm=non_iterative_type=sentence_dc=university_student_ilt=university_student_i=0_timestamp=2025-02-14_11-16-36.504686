Autonomous vehicles are a focus of research today.
As drones become more common in civilian and commercial use there is a growing need for them to operate on their own.
Civil drones are being navigated using road-tracking due to government regulations.
We propose a data-driven solution for UAVs to navigate city streets by learning to fly like an expert pilot.
Our classifier is based on a 39-layered model that looks at images to see if they contain roads.
Our system performs better than many existing models for imitation learning.
Data was captured from a drone flown by experienced pilots in urban and semi-urban areas.
Permissions were taken from the relevant authorities to ensure safety during data collection.
We were able to navigate through roads without crashing or overshooting 98.44% of the time.
MAVNet allows drones to fly at high speeds of up to 6 meters per second.
We compare our results with other advanced methods of vision and navigation.
Intelligent systems can help reduce traffic accidents.
Recognizing traffic signs in self-driving cars is a big challenge.
Machine learning techniques like Random Forest and deep learning models are used for classifying traffic signs.
They achieve good results on a specific data-set but struggle with other traffic sign recognition challenges.
We propose a new system that performs well on many tasks and outdoes the current best systems.
Residual convolutional blocks with skip connections
We achieved a 99.33% accuracy in a German sign recognition test and 99.17% accuracy in a Belgian traffic sign classification test.
We propose a new learning technique that uses less memory and computing power.
We introduce Ignition an end-to-end neural network architecture for training self-driving vehicles.
The model is a modified version of ResNet-18 that is trained on images from the front of a racing car and makes decisions on steering.
We don't train the model to identify specific road features like track outlines or distances to other cars but it can still learn these features automatically.
We present a way to use a neural network trained on one task to help with a similar task in a different setting.
A conventional CNN is used for end-to-end control mapping a single camera image to a steering command.
We added a new task to the CNN to help it learn to predict how much a car is departing from its lane.
A source network is trained on the source domain and then used to train another network for a different task in a different domain.
Steering commands from the source and target network are combined and used to control a car.
We used two simulators TORCS and GTAV for the source and target domains.
Our method was better at safely controlling cars than other methods.
One major issue with deep learning techniques is the lack of training data.
There are limited datasets available for industrial robotics but many for self-driving cars.
We previously trained a special kind of computer model to identify robot bodies in images and estimate their joint positions using just a 2D image but it was only able to work with a specific type of robot.
We extended our method to work with a new robot arm the Kuka LBR iiwa.
Instead of collecting large datasets we collect a number of smaller ones each with a few hundred frames and use transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained CNN to a new robot with different features.
Transfer learning is useful in this field and needs smaller training datasets it trains faster and reaches similar accuracy to the original method and sometimes even improves it.
Moral responsibility is a concern in automated decision-making.
We present methods for modeling and controlling systems of self-driving vehicles that transport people in cities and move to different areas to maintain good service.
We cast a self-driving car system in a closed traffic network with people leaving.
A real-time rebalancing algorithm was designed and tested in New York City using an eight-vehicle robot system.
In New York, 8000 robotic taxis can meet the current demand roughly 70% of the size of the current taxi fleet.
We extend our study to include how vehicles rebalancing affects traffic congestion.
This paper provides a way to coordinate self-driving cars and shows the benefits of a network of robotic vehicles.
The digital revolution will transform our economy and many societal institutions.
There are also tremendous risks to our society.
The automation of many tasks and vehicles is now shifting to the automation of society.
We're at a crossroads and need to decide between a society where decisions are made by those in power and then enforced or one where everyone has a say and works together.
Modern information and communication systems enable both private and public sectors.
Human dignity and democracy are important for a society to be livable and successful.
When self-driving cars become a reality passengers will need to find new ways to entertain themselves.
Retrieving entertainment content from the data center can slow down its delivery.
