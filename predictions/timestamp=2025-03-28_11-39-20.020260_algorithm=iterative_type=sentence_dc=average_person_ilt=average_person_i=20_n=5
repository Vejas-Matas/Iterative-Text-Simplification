In the modern era of automation and robotics, Researchers are studying self-driving cars in both schools and businesses.
With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, tracking navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been made as a simplified a 39-layered model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
