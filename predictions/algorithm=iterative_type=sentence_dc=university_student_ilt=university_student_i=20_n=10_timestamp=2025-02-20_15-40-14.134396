autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research
There is an increased need for autonomy in unmanned aerial vehicles.


Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads from the input frames.


Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that low risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process.
With a large amount of data from drones, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or
