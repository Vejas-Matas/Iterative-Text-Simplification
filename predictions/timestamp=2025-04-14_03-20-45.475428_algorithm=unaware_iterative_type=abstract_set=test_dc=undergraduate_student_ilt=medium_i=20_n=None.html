                  <div class="text-muted">Perception of the environment is <strong> necessary</strong> for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most <strong> robots (humanoids</strong> and wheeled <strong> robots)</strong> rely on planar regions. For <strong> humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics),</strong> a 2D map is not sufficient <strong> because</strong> they can step over and onto <strong> objects, so they</strong> need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> bring</strong> another level of complexity, <strong> because it</strong> can lead to necessary replanning or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low <strong> processor</strong> cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

These applications <strong> are designed</strong> for the Cybiko personal digital assistant, <strong> which offers a cost-effective</strong> alternative to other <strong> hardware options. The</strong> Cybiko PDA was <strong> discontinued recently. Consequently,</strong> these applications <strong> needed</strong> to be <strong> adapted</strong> to other platforms to <strong> maintain their usefulness. To avoid the time-consuming task</strong> of porting each application to <strong> various platforms due</strong> to <strong> different APIs</strong> and networking protocols, we <strong> developed</strong> the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer <strong> simplifies</strong> the Cybiko networking structure and interface, <strong> making it easier to adapt</strong> Cybiko applications to <strong> different platforms without needing</strong> to <strong>make significant changes to the code.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Perception of the environment is <strong> necessary</strong> for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most <strong> robots (humanoids</strong> and wheeled <strong> robots)</strong> rely on planar regions. For <strong> humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics),</strong> a 2D map is not sufficient <strong> because</strong> they can step over and onto <strong> objects, so they</strong> need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> bring</strong> another level of complexity, <strong> because it</strong> can lead to necessary replanning or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low <strong> processor</strong> cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

Manipulations can be as subtle as <strong> changing the</strong> source <strong> code, which is the programming instructions,</strong> or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. To respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, algorithms <strong> are used</strong> to detect phishing websites based on their content, employing a data set consisting of 17,992 phishing attacks targeting 159 different brands. The results of the experiments using different approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Gene</strong> editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation. Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health <strong> goals.</strong> However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation <strong> (IVF)</strong> and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. <strong> The</strong> necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been <strong> discussed.</strong> The discourse on moral obligations of future <strong> generations</strong> seems to imply that women might be <strong> required</strong> to reproduce with IVF. Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed. These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men. <strong> There are no</strong> unified feminist conclusion about the merits and risks of human genome <strong> modification.

Instead of porting each application to individual platforms, which would prove to be extremely time consuming because of other <strong> API&amp;#x27;s</strong> and networking protocols, we created the Messaging Layer. This layer <strong> simplifies</strong> the Cybiko networking <strong> code, making it easy to transfer the</strong> applications to other platforms with minimal code alteration. <strong></strong></div>

A new cell biological model <strong> explains how muscle cells remember their previous growth. Previously</strong> untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and myonuclei <strong> remain stable</strong> in the <strong> body</strong> for at least 15 <strong> years. If this</strong> memory exists in humans, early strength training <strong> might be</strong> a <strong> good</strong> public health advice. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, <strong> it</strong> has been <strong> said</strong> that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in <strong> muscles</strong> in which <strong> muscle growth</strong> is <strong> 'remembered'</strong> such that a fibre that has lost its mass, can regain <strong> it</strong> faster than <strong> untrained</strong> fibres. A new <strong> model,</strong> with the most reliable methods for identifying <strong> myonuclei (nuclei in muscle fiber),</strong> can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells <strong> (quiescent cells acting as a reserve population of cells for regeneration of muscle)</strong> before <strong> muscle</strong> growth. Even <strong> after</strong> grave <strong> muscle loss,</strong> the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against <strong> programmed cell death</strong> observed <strong> during</strong> muscle <strong> loss.</strong> Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster <strong> during strength</strong> exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important <strong> 'memory'</strong> of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit <strong> for old people,</strong> and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice. <strong></strong></div>
