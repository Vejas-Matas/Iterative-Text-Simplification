In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of drones being used in both civilian and commercial settings, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to rules set by governments, road navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning based approach to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
