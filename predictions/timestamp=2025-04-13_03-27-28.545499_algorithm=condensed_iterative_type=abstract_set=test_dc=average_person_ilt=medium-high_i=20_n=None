Eating some protein after exercise, repeated every 4 hours has been shown to build muscle.
However, a second finding was that even when protein was consumed in amounts shown to be optimally effective to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, alcohol reduced MPS by ∼24%, resulting in a partial recovery of muscle growth compared to protein alone.
Phishers make fake websites look like real ones to trick people. Manipulations can be subtle, such as changing the source code or adding/removing content. Software can identify fake websites by checking their content, using a large collection of fake website attacks. Some methods can detect fake websites with a high success rate and few errors.
It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance. Several observational studies lend support to this hypothesis, with an inverse relationship noted between the frequency of eating and adiposity. This review looks at the results of a study that combined data from various experiments on the effect of eating frequency on body composition. Feeding frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and body fat percentage as well as an increase in fat-free mass. However, the positive findings might be due to just one study, so it's unclear if eating more often really helps with body composition. In conclusion, although the initial results of this review suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be interpreted with circumspection.
They drank the beverages every half hour.
The focus of the early post-exercise period (i.e., 1–8 h) is to enhance processes that help the body recover and get stronger after exercise [1].
Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. We conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including native English and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker. It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs. The study's findings can help designers and developers improve VUIs for various users worldwide by adding more languages and better voice recognition.
We created a layer to help move Cybiko apps to other platforms with simple changes.
Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. Muscles remember their past strength because of the way their cells grow. It involves identifying the cells that help muscles grow. Even if muscles shrink, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Muscles that have been exercised before can gain strength faster when exercised again.
Making decisions by machines can cause trouble, including self-driving cars and organ swaps.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. They can step over small obstacles. Dynamic obstacles require the robot to replan its path to avoid collisions. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system uses this info to plan paths fast. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for real-time footstep planning.
As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy. In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features. We use a feature that already exists in similar systems to improve speech recognition. The first computer system employs the features that help improve speech recognition in similar systems. Then, the second computer system for primary acoustic modeling employs both the features and the acoustics features. When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of how well it recognizes speech on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that an obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process (specifically, drug molecules, compounds in high throughput screening libraries, combinatorial chemistry building blocks and nondrug molecules). High-throughput screening compounds are similar to drugs. It is suggested that the analysis of pharmacophore profiles could be used as an additional tool for the optimization of compound selection and library design processes, thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects.
The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation. Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it could improve public health. However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. The discussion on future generations' moral obligations implies that women might have to use IVF. If an artificial womb is not developed, future generations will be born as either boys or girls, and women's opinions will be important. Despite the lack of a unified feminist conclusion in the discussions about the merits and risks of human genome modification, there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
Limitation in display size and resolution on mobile devices is one of the main obstacles for wide-spread use of web applications in a wireless environment. Web pages are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with low resolution. One solution is to rebuild web pages manually for these devices, but it takes a lot of time. In this paper, we propose a document segmentation and presentation system. The system breaks down web pages into smaller parts for different screens. The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding. Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation.
This paper presents M-CALL, a mobile computer-assisted language learning courseware for Korean language learners. Since conventional computer-assisted language learning is often boring, it uses a game to make learning more fun. M-CALL works on a smartphone with Wi-Fi for learning on the go. As you learn Korean, you get to have a virtual pet. You practice with a Korean language test. It consists of a cyber pet game, mobile learning courseware, mobile learning system, and mobile tutoring. It provides various functions for Korean language learning. Currently, the prototype M-CALL was designed and partly implemented between mobile PDA and personal computer.
In this paper, a lab automation drone is introduced. Here, a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft. The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to dexterously manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high throughput systems (HTS). The resulting drone could augment existing HTS operations. A 6-axis robotic arm is designed. Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given.
Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving cars. These systems make self-driving vehicles vulnerable to attacks like Sybil attacks and DoS. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles. The system uses AI to detect DoS attacks. VANETs add new threats to self-driving cars. The system is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.
