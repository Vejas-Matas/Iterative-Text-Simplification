In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are now the focus of research.
With the ever increasing number of drones used in civilian and commercial activities, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding operating limits for drones, ground-based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning based solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates images to detect roads
