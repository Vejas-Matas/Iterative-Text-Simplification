In the present era, self-driving cars studied by academics and businesses.
With aerial vehicles are used in many sectors, a need for autonomy.
Due to regulations regarding drone operation limits, tracking is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve these tasks, we suggest an imitation solution, computer solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning from an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in a fast Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the frames.
