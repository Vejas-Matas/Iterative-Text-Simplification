Eating 20-25 grams of protein after exercise and every 4 hours maximises muscle growth.
Even when a certain amount of protein is consumed after exercise, alcohol can still reduce muscle protein synthesis by about 24%.
Phishers change the code of websites to look like real ones and avoid detection. To stop this a group of algorithms was made to detect fake websites based on their content. They used a big list of phishing attacks on 159 different brands. The results show that some of these algorithms can detect fake websites very well with very few mistakes.
Eating small meals often is thought to help with weight loss and maintaining weight. Some studies suggest that eating more often is linked to less body fat. This review looked at studies that tested the effect of eating frequency on body fat and muscle mass. The results showed that eating more often might help with weight loss but this could be due to just one study.
People drank beverages every 30 minutes.
The early post-exercise period is about fixing the body's functions that were disrupted by exercise and making it adapt to the exercise.
We studied how people use the Google Home Smart Speaker. 20 people participated in the study. Some were native English speakers and some were not. The native English speakers had better experiences using the device. The study shows that people's English skills affect how well they use voice-controlled devices.
We developed applications for networking on the Cybiko personal digital assistant. However the Cybiko was discontinued so we had to move the applications to other platforms. To avoid rewriting each application for a different platform we created the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer helps applications work on different platforms with only small changes.
Skeletal muscle cells have a memory that helps them grow faster when they are exercised. This memory is caused by the presence of certain cell nuclei that are recruited from other cells when the muscle is first exercised. Even if the muscle is subjected to atrophy these nuclei are retained and help the muscle grow faster when it is exercised again. This memory can last for a long time and might be permanent.
Automated decision-making raises concerns about responsibility.
Mobile robots must be able to perceive their surroundings to navigate safely. Most robots rely on 2D maps but humanoid robots need a 3D map to step over objects. Our system extracts 2D regions from 3D maps and detects moving obstacles. It then uses this information to create prediction maps and plan paths in real time at low cost. Our system can plan paths in under 10 milliseconds.
Humanoid robots make speech recognition harder because of internal noise from their moving parts. This paper proposes a new way to improve speech recognition in robots. It uses the motor's on and off states as extra information to find the most important sounds. We used a technique called bottleneck features that helps deep neural networks recognize speech better. We combined the motor's on and off states with the sound features to train the first neural network. The second network then used the new features and sound features to improve speech recognition. Our algorithm worked better than the old ones and achieved an 11% improvement.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to compare different types of compounds. It found differences between drugs and compounds in high-throughput screening libraries. This could help improve the success of new drug discoveries by selecting better compounds.
Gene editing can be used to improve health care for future generations. This might involve in vitro fertilization and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. However the role of women in this process has not been discussed. The current debate on the moral obligations of future generations seems to imply that women might be required to reproduce with IVF. This would be gendered unless an artificial womb is developed.
Mobile devices have a small screen and low resolution which makes it hard to view web pages. This is a problem for devices like PDAs and WebTV. To solve this problem web pages need to be customised for each device.
A new language learning system called M-CALL is presented. It uses a cyber pet game to make learning more fun. This system runs on a personal digital assistant with a wireless internet connection. It grows a virtual pet by solving language learning problems. These problems come from a nationally recognized Korean language test. The system has four main parts: a cyber pet game, a language learning course, a mobile learning system, and a mobile tutor.
A new concept for a lab automation drone is presented. It has a robotic arm attached to a flying machine. The arm can pick up small objects like test tubes used in high speed testing. The drone can help with these tests.
Self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to attacks due to their communication systems. These systems make vehicles reliant on external communication via VANETs. VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles. These vehicles are vulnerable to many types of attacks such as DoS and black hole attacks. A new security system is proposed to secure self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The system uses a neural network to detect malicious vehicles.
