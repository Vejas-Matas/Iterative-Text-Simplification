The identified complexity of the passage is Average. Since the identified complexity (Average) is not higher than DC (Average person), the answer is No.
The complexity of the passage is above the desired complexity for an "Average person". Yes
Propose a simplification of the identified section: "Due to government guidelines for drone operation, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest."\n\nThis simplification removes the phrase "regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones" which is the main source of complexity.\n\nWhat is the information loss and the severity of it?
Propose a simplification of the identified section of the passage.
Is determined complexity higher than DC (Average person)? No
The determined complexity of the passage is higher than DC (Average person). Answer is: Yes
The most complex parts of the original passage are:\n- "6-8 years of flying experience" (technical detail)\n- "urban and semi-urban streets" (technical term)\n\nThe complexity of the passage is around 3.5 out of 5 (based on Flesch-Kincaid readability test). The DC for "Average person" is around 2.5 out of 5. Therefore, the determined complexity is higher than DC (Yes).
Is the determined complexity of the new passage higher than DC (Average person)? Yes
The complexity of the passage is higher than the desired complexity of an "Average person". Answer: Yes
The complexity of the passage is above the DC (Average person). Answer: Yes
