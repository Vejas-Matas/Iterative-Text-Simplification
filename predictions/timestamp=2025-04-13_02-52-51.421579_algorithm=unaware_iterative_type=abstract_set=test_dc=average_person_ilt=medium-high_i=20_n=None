The ingestion of 20-25 grams of high quality protein after exercise has been shown to maximise the anabolic response in skeletal muscle.
However, a second finding was that even when protein was consumed in amounts needed to stimulate muscle protein synthesis during post-exercise recovery, alcohol decreased protein production by about 24%, representing only a partial ‘rescue’ of the response compared with protein alone.
Phishers continue to alter the source code of the web pages used in their attacks to mimic changes to legitimate websites of spoofed organizations and to avoid detection by phishing countermeasures. Manipulations can be as subtle as source code changes or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. To respond to these changes, a set of algorithms is used to detect phishing websites based on their content. The results of the experiments using a variety of different approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of over 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance. Several studies support this hypothesis, with an inverse relationship noted between the frequency of eating and body fat. This review looks at how often eating affects body fat and muscle mass. Feeding frequency was associated with reduced body fat and increased lean mass. However, the positive findings were the product of a single study, casting doubt as to whether more frequent meals confer beneficial effects on body composition. In conclusion, although the initial results suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be interpreted with circumspection.
Subjects ingested the beverages every 30 minutes.
The focus of the early post-exercise period (i.e., 1–8 h) is to restore the body's balance and physical functions and for promoting adaptations to training [1].
Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. We tested the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 people. Language skills help users get the most out of voice assistants. Adding more languages and improving voice recognition can make the device more useful for everyone.
In recent years, we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking. These applications have been written for the Cybiko personal digital assistant, an inexpensive alternative to other hardware. It recently discontinued. As a result, these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful. We created a tool to make it easier to move the applications.
Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. Myonuclei appear to be more resistant to dying off in muscles that are shrinking. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice.
Computer decisions are a major concern in that, with applications in transportation and healthcare.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a 2D map isn't enough because they can step over objects and need to know the height of the environment. Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning.
As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy. In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features. For this, we consider a basic system for initial speech recognition modeling. The motor's on/off state helps the system improve audio signal recognition. The second model uses features from the first model and audio signals to improve speech recognition. When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process (specifically, drug molecules, compounds in high throughput screening libraries, combinatorial chemistry building blocks and nondrug molecules). Differences were found between the pharmacophore profiles of drug molecules and high-throughput screening compounds. It is suggested that the analysis of pharmacophore profiles could be used as an additional tool for optimizing compound selection and library design, thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects.
The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation. Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it might improve the health of individuals and communities, and, if successful, might be seen as a public good. Future generations will need IVF. Women may need to use IVF. Babies will be either male or female. There is a lack of clarity on the role of women in gene editing discussions, making it urgent to address this issue.
Limitation in display size and resolution on mobile devices is one of the main obstacles for wide-spread use of web applications in a wireless environment. Web pages are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV. Manual reconstruction of web pages for these devices would ease the problem; however, the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have to customize a web page for each possible display device. In this paper, we propose a document segmentation and presentation system. The system automatically divides a web document into a number of logical segments based on the screen size and the structure and content of the document. Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation. The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding.
This paper presents M-CALL, a mobile computer-assisted language learning courseware for Korean language learners. Since conventional computer-assisted language learning is often boring, it exploits a cyber pet game to increase the learner’s interest. M-CALL runs on a personal digital assistant with public wireless LAN for mobile learning. It grows a cyber pet by solving problems of Korean language learning. Korean Proficiency Test (KPT), a nationally certified Korean language test, was used as problem sets. It consists of cyber pet game, mobile learning courseware, mobile learning system, and mobile tutoring. It provides various functions for Korean language learning. Currently, the prototype M-CALL was designed and partly implemented between mobile PDA and personal computer.
In this paper, a lab automation drone notional concept is introduced. Here, a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft. The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high-speed testing systems. The resulting drone could augment existing operations. A robotic arm and gripper design are presented. Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given.
Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems. These communication systems make self-driving vehicles vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS). In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The system uses a special kind of artificial intelligence to detect a common type of attack on VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS).
