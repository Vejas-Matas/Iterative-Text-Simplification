Eating 20-25 grams of protein after exercise helps build muscle.
Even with the right amount of protein to help muscles recover after exercise, drinking alcohol reduced muscle growth by 24%.
Phishers change the code of websites to look like real websites and avoid detection. To catch these changes a team of algorithms is used to detect phishing sites based on their content. These algorithms use a large data set of known phishing attacks and can detect over 90% of them with few mistakes.
Eating smaller meals more often may help with weight loss and keeping weight off. Some studies suggest that eating less often is linked to being overweight. A review of studies that tested the effect of eating frequency on weight was done. The review found that eating more often was linked to losing fat and gaining muscle. However a closer look at the data showed that the positive results were mainly from one study. This makes it unclear if eating more often really helps with weight.
People drank a drink every 30 minutes.
The first few hours after exercise are important for the body to recover and adapt.
People use voice assistants like Google Home but they mainly support English language. We tested Google Home with 20 people who speak English and those who don't. People who speak English well had better experiences with the device. This shows that how well someone speaks English affects how they use voice assistants.
We developed applications for teaching networking on a device called Cybiko. But the Cybiko was discontinued. So we had to move the applications to other devices. Instead of copying each app to every device we created a layer that helps applications work on different devices with little changes.
Skeletal muscle remembers its past experiences through a process called cellular memory. When a muscle fibre grows and then loses mass, it can regain mass faster than a new fibre. This happens because the muscle fibre has more myonuclei which are like cells that help the fibre grow. These myonuclei are protected and can last for a long time, even up to 15 years. This means that muscle memory might be very long lasting in humans and could be a good reason to start strength training early in life.
Automated decision-making raises moral concerns.
Mobile robots need to navigate safely in changing environments. They use maps to plan their paths. However humans and small robots can step over objects and need height information. Our system first maps the environment and detects moving obstacles. Then it uses this information to plan paths in real time. This system works quickly and allows for safe navigation.
Noise from humanoid robots makes it hard for them to understand what people are saying. A new way to make robots understand speech better is proposed. It uses the information of the robot's motor on or off state to help identify what people are saying. The robot first learns to recognize sounds and then uses the motor information to improve its understanding of speech. This new method works better than the old ones in recognizing words and sounds.
Drug discovery researchers used a method to compare different types of compounds. They found big differences between drugs and compounds that are tested many at a time. This could help them choose the best compounds to use in research and make it more likely to find new medicines.
Gene editing could solve health care issues. It might improve the health of individuals and communities. However, this would require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. Women would likely be involved in this process. The moral implications of this have not been fully discussed. The role of women in enhancing future generations needs to be clarified.
Mobile devices can't show all web pages because of small screens and low resolution. Designers would have to make separate versions of each page for different devices which is a big problem. We propose a system that breaks down a web page into smaller parts based on screen size and the page's structure. It also includes overviews and summaries to help users navigate.
A new language learning tool called M-CALL was created for people learning Korean. It uses a game to make learning more fun. M-CALL can be used on a personal digital assistant with a wireless internet connection. The more you learn, the more your virtual pet grows. The tool includes a language test to see how well you're doing. It has several features to help with learning the Korean language. A prototype of M-CALL was made and tested on a mobile device and a computer.
A new robotic drone is being developed. It has a mechanical arm that can pick up small objects like test tubes and micro-arrays. This drone could help with laboratory work.
Self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different types of attacks due to their communication systems. These systems make self-driving vehicles susceptible to various malicious attacks. We propose a system to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The system can detect a common type of attack called Denial-of-Service.
