In the modern era of automation and robotics, self-driving cars are the main focus of research.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in civilian and commercial activities, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Because of rules, road tracking is popular.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning approach to UAV navigation in city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep neural network model, that evaluates the presence of roads using reconstructions of the input frames.
