Autonomous vehicles are a focus of research today.
As drones become more common in civilian and commercial use there is a growing need for them to operate on their own.
Civil drones are being navigated using road-tracking due to government regulations.
We propose a data-driven solution for UAVs to navigate city streets by learning to fly like an expert pilot.
Our classifier is based on a 39-layered model that looks at images to see if they contain roads.
Our system performs better than many existing models for imitation learning.
Data was captured from a drone flown by experienced pilots in urban and semi-urban areas.
Permissions were taken from the relevant authorities to ensure safety during data collection.
We were able to navigate through roads without crashing or overshooting 98.44% of the time.
MAVNet allows drones to fly at high speeds of up to 6 meters per second.
