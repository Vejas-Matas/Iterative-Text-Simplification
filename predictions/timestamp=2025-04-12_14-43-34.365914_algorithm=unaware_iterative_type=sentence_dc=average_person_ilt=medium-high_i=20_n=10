In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to regulations set by the government, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep artificial neural network model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system performs better in terms of speed and performance than many existing models for imitation learning using custom design.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by people with experience flying drones.
Permissions were taken from the right authorities that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved.
We have been able to drive safely on roads with a 98% accuracy.
The performance of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at up to 6 seconds.
