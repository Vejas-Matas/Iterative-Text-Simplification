In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are now being researched by experts from both fields.
With the growing use of drones is increasing and they need to be autonomous in civilian and commercial domains too. The passage's complexity is high (FKGL 10.58).
Due to safety rules for drones, road tracking is now more popular.
We try to make drones work
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
Our system is powerful that's better than many efficiently.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that the risk to pedestrians is minimal during data collection. FKGL score is high.
We have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with data from drones. FKGL score is a measure of the passage's complexity.
Efficiency of the drone's system enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.
