Inappropriate use of medicines increases the risk of hospital admissions for the elderly. This leads to unnecessary suffering for the patients and a great financial cost to society. A medicine decision support system can provide an overview of a patient's medicine use and detect unsuitable drugs. Our study aimed to evaluate if a mobile medicine decision support system is useful and user-friendly for nurses in home care. The nurses found that the system increased prevention and safety and was useful and user-friendly.
access to patient appointment schedules can help clinicians manage time and problems better. Many healthcare organizations use a special computer system to manage appointments but it's hard for doctors to access this information. Also staff other than the clinician's personal assistant may manage scheduling making it difficult for clinicians to stay informed of changes. Many a clinician today uses a personal digital assistant containing basic calendaring functionality Our “PalmOversite” project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating appointment schedule information into a PDA calendar making schedule information much more readily available to the clinician
We describe the development and implementation of a personal digital assistant (PDA) based electronic system to collect and upload monthly bacteriology data into the PIH-EMR. A pilot study was conducted to test the use of this system. The system was implemented in one health district while another district continued to use the paper-based system. The PDA-based system reduced the time it took to process data from 54.8 days to 6.2 days. It also reduced the number of errors from 10.1% to 2.8%. Users gave positive feedback about the system. The system will be studied further to see how it can improve delays, errors, and costs.

The proliferation of mobile devices such as smart phones and Personal Digital Assistant opens new ways for developing mobile E-commerce systems. In Mcommerce systems we still see many common components that we have in standard E-commerce applications such as web servers and database servers. However these new applications raise some unique challenges. For example Mobile devices have limitations like small screens and slow processors which make mobile app development different from desktop software development. We learned about these differences while creating an app for booking hotel rooms. Questions which are posed when designing M-commerce system include What kind of information do the users want to access via mobile devices How can we provide useful applications with limited user input facility How can we test a M-commerce system In this paper we discuss some issues for mobile commerce systems Our prototype easyHotel is an useful software that allows booking hotel rooms via mobile phones
It is acknowledged that web content should be adapted for mobile platforms to account for mobile restrictions. We suggest adapting content for each platform. We use two main approaches for adapting content automated conversion and specifying what content to show on each platform balancing quality and maintenance costs. We propose a simple framework for content adaptation to avoid this trade-off. We apply our approach to an example application to demonstrate how it reduces development and maintenance effort.

In recent years we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking. These applications have been written for the Cybiko personal digital assistant an inexpensive alternative to other hardware. Unfortunately the Cybiko PDA was recently discontinued. As a result these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful. Instead of porting each application to individual platforms we created the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer helps Cybiko apps work on other platforms with little code change.
Unlike many other classes of hardware, smartcards do not have the ability to communicate securely with the user. They are difficult to utilize because the owner is not informed. We explore the area where smartcards meet other  more powerful machines. A personal digital assistant is an extension of the user's private sphere. It must have enough functionality to create trustworthy digital signatures to speak for the user. A smartcard can act as a memory aid, helping the owner remember addresses and phone numbers. Smartcards are designed to be tamper resistant. However, they cannot create trustworthy digital signatures alone. A smartcard must be supported by some infrastructure outside the card. We demonstrate that trustworthy digital signatures can be made using a standard. Nontrivial systems can be constructed by utilizing smartcards. Smartcards are here to stay, finding ways to apply them is prudent.

We show how this is achieved using a device that people carry and the internet.
The design was a trial conducted in a resident clinic. Internal medicine residents received a tool for their work. Unannounced patients presented to the doctors. Safety was checked from the prescriptions given to the patients. Each prescription was reviewed by a group of doctors.\n\nPrescriptions were judged as safe or unsafe. After the intervention, the people who used the tool made fewer mistakes with prescriptions compared to those who didn't. The main outcome was how safe the doctors were with their prescriptions. At the start, the two groups were similar. People who used the tool made fewer mistakes than those who didn't.
Recently pedestrian navigation has been studied by many researchers which provides pedestrians with a similar function of car navigation. On the other hand a 3dimensional map has been utilized as a simulation tool in city and landscape planning and other engineering fields. The 3D maps will give more intuitive information compared to conventional 2-dimensional ones. In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on 3D maps and describe technologies required and its use situations. Secondly we compare effectiveness of D and 3D maps for navigation by object search experiments under conditions 3D maps with and without texture display sizes on a phone and a handheld device. The experimental results show that 3D maps with texture on mobile phone display size and 3D maps without texture on PDA display size are superior to 2D maps in search time and error rate. From these results we can say the effectiveness of 3D maps in pedestrian navigation.

The IDT77903 ATM card is a 25 Mbps NIC with a PCI bus interface and it costs less than $100 (US). Integrating this card into our device as a network interface will make highspeed videoconferencing and multimedia applications easily implementable.

Little is known about how new mobile applications emerge in commercial environments. The evolution of new applications is a process of social interaction between different groups. This is illustrated by the early evolution of the personal digital assistant. Established communities try to impose their own definitions on new mobile technology, forcing newer players to redefine a new application area.
We use mobile phones and digital assistants to access the Web. We also created a system that changes Web content into a format that's easy to view on mobile devices. We implemented a system that transforms Web content into a format that's useful for mobile terminals. The presentation of Web content depends on the terminal type. Mobile and desktop terminals have some differences in device characteristics that affect the presentation. When changing the access style, the presentation should be adjusted for the terminal type. We developed a method for visual presentation. We represent the emotional aspect of a Web page by adjusting the background color of the screen. We emphasize the subject of the content by its main word. We segment the picture of the content into pieces and present one after another. These procedures can be applied to any type of terminal.
We have developed a system called The Beijing Explorer. It exchanges information between users in real time. Users can see their position and chats on a screen using the system in real time. We tested the system twice at the Palace Museum in Beijing. The results showed that the service was valuable and interesting.
A truly personal machine called a private machine and implemented as a Personal Digital Assistant is fundamentally different from traditional machines. It is very private and unique in a way that network and power failures will not be rare. Designing systems where PDAs are treated as first class citizens is a private : assets will be stored in PDAs. Ownership and control of these assets and the media that store and communicate them should remain with the user. This must be reflected in the design of systems for private We use a design approach that helps systems show users information rather than hide it. This way users can make better decisions about their data and control their system. The system we have designed and implemented under this design approach is presented and discussed.

This paper presents a method to generate pseudonyms in a personal environment. Each user can generate his pseudonym locally in his own security environment. There is no need for any information interchange between parties, except for unique identifiers for each user and device. The holder can prove he generated a specific pseudonym without revealing his identity. He can also reveal his identity by disclosing the pseudonym. The verifier can be sure the presenter of the pseudonym is the holder of the pseudonym. The user's and device identifiers are used to generate unique pseudonyms, and they are stored in encrypted form.
Mobile devices are used for location-based services such as city maps, route planning, and traffic information. These devices do not have as much power or storage as a computer or laptop. To solve this problem, a route computation for public transport was developed for a digital assistant. Breaking down the route computation process into smaller steps helps to save power on the device.

Digital assistants are becoming more common in our daily lives \nIn interacting with these assistants users may do several tasks at once
As extensive research has shown individuals suffer from diverse biases in decision-making. In our paper we analyze the effects of decision-making biases of managers on organizational performance. In the simulations managers made decisions based on different company structures and pay systems and these decisions were influenced by biases in decision-making. The results show how biases interact and affect company performance in various situations Surprisingly some combinations of biases actually improve performance but each bias on its own can be a problem
Big data delivers immense benefits in marketing, healthcare, and more. The current privacy framework is strained by big data. As we interact with artificial agents, it raises legal and philosophical questions. The machine may exacerbate or draw attention to ethical challenges, but humans must be held accountable. Policymakers should devise guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling.
Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups. We conducted a study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 people to understand how they interact with it. The study found that native English speakers had a better user experience than non-native English speakers. This suggests that language skills are important for interacting with devices like this.
the smart speakers cannot distinguish human voice from machine voice\na way to tell if a person or machine is controlling the smart speaker is needed\nto prevent fake voice commands when no one is home we propose a system to detect a human nearby using a speaker and microphone
As smart speakers become more common people will get used to talking to them. Sometimes they make mistakes like not understanding what you said or not playing the music you asked for. This can be frustrating. When this happens it's important for the speaker to give a good response. Different companies have different ways of doing this. We looked at what people prefer. We found that people are happier and think the speaker is more sincere when it apologizes. When the speaker can't play music, humor doesn't make a difference. But when the speaker can't understand, being funny makes things worse.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to compare different types of compounds. Significant differences were found between drug molecules and compounds in screening libraries. This could help improve the success of new drug discovery projects.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system was developed as a powerful technology for targeted genome editing and gene regulation. These applications require the design of efficient and specific single guide RNAs.
Gene editing could be used to solve issues related to healthcare allocation. It might improve the health of future generations and communities. However, this will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. The role of women in this scenario is unclear. They may be required to reproduce with IVF. This raises challenging issues that require a wider perspective.
CRISPR-Cas is a tool that is widely used for gene editing. The CRISPR-Cas system can cause problems if used for a long time. Anti-CRISPR proteins which are powerful molecules that inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing especially for gene therapy. More research on these proteins would help us understand how bacteria and viruses interact. Therefore it is necessary to collect and integrate data on various types of anti-CRISPRs.
CRISPR has become a hot research area. It is used to edit DNA sequences. Gene editing techniques have been developed to achieve different aims. The genes can be removed, repaired, silenced, or activated. This makes it a powerful tool.
The CRISPR-Cpf1 system has been successfully applied in genome editing. However, the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system varies among different sequences. A model was created to predict the efficiency for any given sequence. A web service application, CRISPR-DT, is available to help users design optimal sequences for the CRISPR-Cpf1 system.
Self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to attacks due to their communication systems. These vehicles use external communication via a type of network that adds new threats. These threats contribute to challenges in autonomous systems. The vehicles are vulnerable to various types of malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a security system for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The system relies on a type of neural network to detect a common type of attack. The results show that the proposed system is capable of identifying malicious vehicles.
Self-driving vehicle technologies are progressing rapidly and are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation. One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is safe cooperation among vehicles. When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same space, they might collide or become deadlocked. In this paper, we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points. We present a safe protocol for merge points where self-driving vehicles use their own systems to cooperate with other vehicles. Our results show that our traffic protocol has higher traffic throughput while ensuring safety.
This paper provides a study of how stock prices vary in response to financial disclosures. We specifically shed light into filings for which no categorization of their content exists. We use a data mining approach to automatically categorize the content of regulatory filings from U.S. companies. We then evaluate the stock market reaction. Our evidence suggests a discrepancy among various news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets. We find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating. Our results benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating topics most likely to precede changes in stock valuations.
A significant problem of using deep learning techniques is the limited amount of data available for training. There are some datasets available for the popular problems like item recognition and classification for self-driving cars however it is very limited for the industrial robotics field. In previous work we have used a special type of neural network to identify the robot in the image and figure out its 3D position from a 2D image but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots UR. In this work we extend our method to work with a new robot arm Kuka LBR iiwa which has a significantly different appearance and an additional joint. However instead of collecting large datasets once again we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use transfer learning techniques on the network trained on UR robots to adapt it to a new robot having different shapes and visual features. We have proven that transfer learning is not only applicable in this field but it requires smaller well-prepared training datasets trains significantly faster and reaches similar accuracy compared to the original method even improving it on some aspects.
We introduce a system that trains self-driving cars in a virtual world. The model is a special type of neural network, which is fed in images from the front of a simulated F1 car, and outputs labels for steering, throttle, braking. Importantly, we never explicitly train the model to detect road features like the outline of a track or distance to other cars; instead, we illustrate that these features can be automatically learned.
Humanoid robots have a problem with speech recognition accuracy due to internal noise from moving parts. A new speech recognition system is proposed that uses the motor on/off state to improve accuracy. This system uses a two-step approach. First, it uses motor on/off data and acoustic features as input for the first deep neural network. Then, the second deep neural network uses the results from the first network and acoustic features to improve accuracy. The results show a significant improvement in phoneme error rate.
Recognizing traffic signs using intelligent systems can reduce the number of accidents worldwide. With self-driving cars, it has become a challenge to solve automatic recognition of traffic signs. Machine learning techniques have been proposed for classifying traffic signs. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that performs well on multiple benchmarks. Our model uses a combination of convolutional blocks and skip connections to achieve high accuracy. We score 99% in German and Belgian traffic sign benchmarks. We also propose a technique that reduces memory and computational complexity.
We present a transfer learning method for the end-to-end control of self-driving cars. This method enables a convolutional neural network trained on a source domain to be used for the same task in a different target domain. A network maps a single front-facing camera image to a steering command. To enable the transfer learning, the network produces a lane departure level. The network is then utilized to train another network to produce a steering command for the target domain. The steering commands are merged according to the lane departure level and used for controlling a car in the target domain. We utilized two simulators, TORCS and GTAV, for the source and target domains, respectively. The proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of stable and safe control of cars.
This paper describes the design and implementation of the Bristol Stock Exchange, a simulation of a financial market. It was made because most major financial markets now use automated trading systems. Researchers can't experiment with real-world exchanges, so they use past trading data. Universities also need a realistic environment to teach students how to create these systems. BSE has been used for teaching and research since 2012 and its code is available for free.
Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worry about it, they will need to find new ways of entertainment. The simulation results show that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached in the areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach can minimize delay. However, retrieving entertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content delivery service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by using Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) structure. First, at DC, a special algorithm predicts which content will be requested in each area. To reduce the car-DC delay, the results are logged into MEC servers attached to roadside units. Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car passengers’ features such as age and gender, a neural network is used to predict age and gender of passengers. Through this, the self-driving car can identify the contents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached. Finally, we formulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhances entertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize content downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a complex technique is applied.
Moral responsibility is a major concern in automated decision-making, with applications in many fields.
A key problem for autonomous car navigation is understanding the current driving situation. This requires extracting information from on-board imagery by classifying the elements of urban scenes into categories such as streets, buildings, pedestrians, and vehicles. A new method combines prior map data with imagery classification to improve accuracy. The results show that this method significantly enhances the classification of urban scene elements compared to what is obtained from imagery alone.
This paper proposes a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for an open-source self-driving system based on Robot Operating System ROS. One approach to creating self-driving systems uses ROS a free platform for robot development. On the other hand the popular approach in the automotive industry is the utilization of MATLAB/Simulink which is software for modeling simulating and analyzing. MATLAB/Simulink provides an interface between ROS and MATLAB/Simulink that enables to create functionalities of ROS-based robots in MATLAB/Simulink. However it is not been fully utilized in the development of self-driving systems yet because there are not enough samples for self-driving and it is difficult for developers to adopt co-development. Therefore we provide a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for a ROS-based self-driving system called Autoware. Autoware is popular open-source software that provides a complete set of self-driving modules. The provided benchmark contains MATLAB/Simulink samples available in Autoware. They help to design ROS-based self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink.
The management of self-driving systems is becoming more complex as the development of self-driving technology progresses Instead of using ROS the automotive industry uses a different system called MATLAB/Simulink for designing self-driving systems These models are incompatible with ROS-based systems To make it work together we need to adapt the code and integrate it into the new system which makes development harder Therefore the proposed framework allows models created using MATLAB/Simulink to be used in a ROS-based self-driving system thereby improving development efficiency Furthermore our evaluations of the proposed framework demonstrated its practical potential
Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars is important but neither industry nor authorities have settled on a standard way to test them. Deploying self-driving cars for testing in regular traffic is a common but costly and risky method which has already caused fatalities. As a safer alternative virtual tests have been proposed. One cannot cover all possible driving situations by testing manually Its too many and too varied. We developed AsFault a tool for automatically generating virtual tests. We demonstrate AsFault by testing the lane keeping feature of an artificial intelligence-based self-driving car software for which AsFault generates scenarios that cause it to drive off the road A video illustrating AsFault in action is available at https://youtu.be/lJ1sa42VLDw
People are now experiencing self-driving cars in their daily lives with the launch of L3 driverless vehicles. This is creating a growing demand for a smooth and efficient autopilot experience. To improve this experience and accelerate the commercialization of self-driving cars, we need to look at how people interact with the car's computer system.

At the brink of the introduction of self-driving vehicles, little is known about how potential users perceive them. This is especially true for self-driving vehicles deployed in public transport services. In this study, the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus is assessed compared to a trip with a regular bus. Based on the responses of 282 respondents from the Netherlands and Germany, a model is estimated. The results show that public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus for short trips. This is due to the finding that people value travel time more for the self-driving bus. Findings from this study suggest that the popularity of self-driving busses decreases with the presence of a human steward on-board. The popularity of self-driving busses also decreases if they are operated as a demand-responsive service. People who are interested in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology perceive the self-driving busses better than others. Preferences towards automated public transport services are expected to evolve along with the transition from demonstration pilots to their deployment in regular operations.
In the wake of the digital revolution, our economy and society will undergo a dramatic transformation. While this transformation has many benefits, it also poses significant risks. The automation of many processes and self-driving vehicles is just the beginning. We are at a crossroads: we can choose between a society where decisions are made top-down and implemented through coercion or technology, or a society where decisions are made freely and coordinated among people. Modern systems enable both options, but the latter has economic benefits. Human dignity, autonomous decision-making, and democracies are under threat, but they must be defended as they are essential for a livable society and success.
This paper addresses the financial markets problem with emphasis on trading systems in banking. With modern computing, cross-regional trading can now be executed quickly. We then discuss a trading system and how it fits in with a bank's components.
We present methods for modeling and controlling autonomous vehicles that transport customers within a city and rebalance themselves. We use a theoretical model to design an algorithm that can be applied to real-world situations. This is demonstrated with a study of New York City where we show that a fleet of 8,000 robotic vehicles could meet current taxi demand in Manhattan. This approach can help coordinate autonomous vehicles and reduce traffic congestion.
Sensor based robot control is more suitable for service and manipulation tasks than model based techniques. It allows the robot to interact with its environment at the contact point, overcoming many difficulties of uncertain models and unknown environments.
Users are exposed to inaccurate and misleading information online. This can cause problems for them. This paper examines the relationship between information, misinformation, and disinformation. It also looks at how to detect misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation and disinformation are related but distinct concepts. Misinformation is a complex idea that is not just about being inaccurate or incomplete.
The growth of social media provides a convenient communication scheme for people but it also spreads misinformation. This is bad for the public. We want to help identify misinformation. We design a system to do this. The system indexes the expertise of users and matches them with suspected misinformation. This helps us judge the credibility of information. We show that our method works by testing it on real data.
The importance of research on misinformation has received wide recognition. This paper aims to address the challenges of this research by conceptualizing misinformation. A model of misinformation is proposed through existing work in the field. This model can guide future research and lay the foundation for a digital library on misinformation. We also present a way to manage misinformation in a digital library and suggest future research directions.
Online Social Networks OSNs have become increasingly popular means of information sharing among users. The spread of news regarding emergency events is common in OSNs and so is the spread of misinformation related to the event. We define as misinformation any false or inaccurate information that is spread either intentionally or unintentionally. In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in OSNs and we focus in particular on the Twitter social network. We use a model to identify suspicious Twitter behavior and uses machine learning to detect misinformation. We tested our approach on a large number of tweets and users and it worked well during emergencies Furthermore our model manages to timely identify misinformation a feature that can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation
The advent of the World Wide Web changed the way we access information. People tend to select information that agrees with their views and form groups with others who share the same opinions. In this environment users help to reinforce their views making it hard to challenge them. This happens when people get their news directly from social media, and since 63% of people do this, one idea is that more people having the same view allows for more misinformation to spread. We looked at how people interact with news on Facebook in different European countries. We compared how people post and interact with different news pages and saw that people in different countries interact differently.
We find that Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain. A model is used to see how communities form online, based on how people interact with the news. Our findings suggest that trust in the news plays a big role against polarization of users online.
Online social media provide users with diverse opinions. We discuss the policy implications of our model highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation. Simultaneously they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to self select the narratives they want to be exposed to. A precise theoretical understanding of such trade offs is still largely missing. Our model looks at how peoples opinions change when they receive new information. Some people change their opinions based on facts while others stick to their original views. We found that the way people connect with each other on the internet affects how they form their opinions. By looking at data from US counties we saw that this is true for how people think about global warming. Furthermore this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation. Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by preserving information diversity in a social network however results also indicate that when confirmation bias grows past an optimal value accuracy declines as biased agents restrict information flow to subgroups.

The widespread online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages. The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. We present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when many cascades are allowed. We provide a model for how misinformation spreads and introduce the concept of cascade priority. We show that solving this problem is very difficult and may take a long time. We also describe types of cascade priority seen in real social networks and design algorithms to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is effective.
Conspiracy theories occur and it is understandable to believe in them. If we examine the evidence for individual conspiracy theories, we often find that they are warranted. The problems with conspiracy theories are not unique to them. The principle that guides the use of evidence by conspiracy theorists may be flawed. There is no initial reason to be skeptical of conspiracy theories based on how they use evidence.
Conspiracy theories have gained much academic and media attention recently due to their large impact on public events However little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media We studied how people on Reddit spread conspiracy theories during the Zika virus outbreak Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people tried to make sense of a public health crisis reflecting their distrust in formal sources of Zika information Practical implications for social computing researchers health practitioners and policymakers are discussed
Conspiracy theories are common in online discussions. They are used to explain events that have not been officially reported or to express political dissent. It is difficult to understand and stop the spread of these theories. To address this issue, we need to develop methods to study conspiracy theories online. This work answers some of these questions by analyzing online discussions on a community called r/conspiracy. We looked at the main elements of a conspiracy theory: the people involved, their actions, and their targets. For example, a common theme is that governments control information. Our study helps us understand how people talk about conspiracy theories and how we can interpret what they say.
Blockchain technology was developed for Bitcoin. It has the potential to be a powerful disruptive force. Individuals and organizations can benefit from it with its ability to increase secure data exchange and make transactions simpler between entities. We investigated factors that influence an individual's intention to use a blockchain cryptocurrency. We found that certain factors determine the acceptance of cryptocurrency and explored their relative importance. This has practical implications in government services.
With the introduction of memory-bound cryptocurrencies such as Monero the implementation of mining code in browser-based JavaScript has become a worthwhile alternative to dedicated mining rigs Based on this technology a new form of parasitic computing widely called cryptojacking or drive-by mining has gained momentum in the web A cryptojacking site secretly uses visitors computers to mine cryptocurrencies In this paper we systematically explore this phenomenon For this we propose a 3-phase analysis approach which enables us to identify mining scripts and we conducted a large study to see how many websites use cryptojacking Cryptojacking is widespread with about 1 in 500 websites using mining scripts Moreover we perform several analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape including a measurement of code characteristics an estimate of expected mining revenue and an evaluation of current countermeasures
Smart contracts are programs that run on the blockchain They've become very popular and are used in many areas including law business and government contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereum's Solidity and translated to bytecode for deployment on the blockchain Once deployed the bytecode is executed on a Turing-complete virtual machine As with all programs smart contracts can be vulnerable to attacks due to programming problems Hence developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing bytecode to detect potential security vulnerabilities In this paper we present Vandal a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts bytecode to logic relations Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the souffle language
Vandal is fast and robust analysing most contracts in a few seconds outperforming the current state of the art tools Oyente EthIR Mythril and Rattle
Bitcoin's popularity has grown over the decade since its creation
In a network where many computers talk to each other directly it is very important to have a mechanism in place that allows the nodes to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks with spam. In this paper we discuss and compare the different approaches to control resources that are used by projects in the cryptocurrency space. The introduced methods are then applied to design a decentralised exchange for Namecoin names or more generally crypto assets as an example.
Cryptocurrency is a new financial technology that has attracted many people around the world. The rapid price fluctuations of cryptocurrency have triggered panic and public security events. We analyzed the price history of the cryptocurrency market. Our analysis shows that the market is fragile and unstable.
Cryptocurrency was built initially as a possible implementation of digital currency then various derivatives were created in a variety of fields such as financial transactions and capital management. This paper aims to help us understand cryptocurrency. We compare it to two other financial assets foreign exchange and stock. Our analysis shows that cryptocurrency is more similar to stock. The cryptocurrency market is fragile and a high-risk market.
The smart device owning rate is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become one of the major payment methods in many areas. Blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and its total value is very high. It is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices. The poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial services in developing countries make this combination especially attractive. There are two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency: high storage costs and slow payment processing. We propose two different ways to make cryptocurrency mobile payment work, one involves a bank and the other does not require a bank. We also provide a solution for banks to follow the rules when they are involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment.
We studied how financial crises affect the market. We found that news on the web can also affect the market. We created a measure called the News Cohesiveness Index (NCI) to track this. We used NCI to analyze news from big news sources from October 2011 to July 2013. We found that when news is very connected, the market moves a lot. This is a way to measure the risk in the market that is better than just counting how many times certain words are used.
In this paper I propose a methodology to study the comovement between the entropy of different financial markets. We looked at the relationship between the stock markets in these four countries. I study how a shock in the entropy in the United States affects the entropy in the other financial markets. I also model the entropy using a dynamic factor model and derive a common factor behind the entropy movements in these four markets.
Mobile phones have evolved into smartphones and fraudsters have evolved with them. Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued, along with ensuring that processes are in place when suspicions are raised. Detecting corporate fraudsters is a constant challenge. A company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of theft.
Phishers continue to alter the source code of the web pages used in their attacks to mimic changes to legitimate websites of spoofed organizations and to avoid detection by phishing countermeasures. To combat phishing attacks a team of algorithms is used to identify phishing websites based on their content. Manipulations can be as subtle as source code changes or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. The results of the experiments using a variety of different content-based approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
Mobile devices are very common in everyone’s day-to-day life. Nowadays such devices come with many features of desktop or laptop. Hence people can use these devices for diverse applications. As the acceptability and usability of such devices are very high there are chances that these devices can be used for illegal activities. The percentage of mobile phones or smart phones involved in cyber crimes is in hike. So it becomes necessary to digitally analyze such devices requiring cyber forensics tools. This paper talks about the different kinds of digital evidence found in Windows Mobile phones and how to safely extract information from them. Also it describes a tool for safely getting information from Windows Mobile devices and WinCE PDAs using a special method to safely extract information from devices.
Detection of different types of image editing operations carried out on an image is an important problem in image forensics. It gives the information about the processing history of an image and can expose forgeries present in an image. Traditional methods can only detect specific types of image editing. They need to know about the editing operations beforehand. To solve this problem we propose a new way to detect image editing using a computer program. The program can tell if an image has been edited or not. The results show that this new way is effective.
The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things devices has made it inevitable that their relevance to digital forensic investigations will increase into the foreseeable future. These devices often have limited standard interfaces for communication. With a focus on security and privacy, built-in encryption is becoming common in consumer-level computing devices. This work explores the use of electromagnetic analysis to assist digital forensic investigations on these devices. Electromagnetic analysis is a technique that uses unintentional electromagnetic emissions to gather information about a device's operations. This approach is non-intrusive and does not require modifying the device. The study discusses various techniques for using electromagnetic analysis and how they can be applied to investigate IoT devices.
The malicious alteration of machine time is a big challenge in computer forensics. Performance figures show the feasibility of our proposal. Detecting changes and reconstructing the timeline of events is very important. However, this can be difficult since the attacker has many opportunities and means to hide such changes. In particular, cloud computing can be manipulated by an attacker. Virtual machines are vulnerable to attacks from their host because the host has more power. As such it is important to guarantee the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud. In this paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in the cloud. We describe a new way to detect and correct changes to the timeline. The proposed framework has been implemented on a special simulator.
Image tampering is a big problem in today's digital world. JPEG images can be easily altered without leaving a trace. Checking these images for tampering has become an important research topic. We still need to figure out how to detect tampering when the same method is used to alter the image. We propose a new way to do this using special characteristics. Our tests show that this method is very effective.
We present a new way to accurately calibrate the model of a humanoid based on its camera. Our technique estimates the model's parameters, including the camera's position and settings. We also developed a way to choose the best settings for the calibration process that balances the number of observations and accuracy. This approach yields better results than randomly chosen settings. Our system requires fewer settings to achieve accurate results. The implementation can be easily applied to different humanoids.
In this paper we present a navigation system that lets robots navigate in cluttered environments. Our system uses a depth camera to track the robot's position and create a map of the environment. It also checks for collisions and leads the robot to its target. We tested this system with a Nao humanoid robot and it successfully navigated through challenging passages.
We introduce an approach to robot navigation through cluttered indoor environments. We propose using already detected objects to estimate obstacle densities and predict costs for path planning. The robot can then navigate through cluttered regions more efficiently and reduce the risk of getting stuck. Our method enables the robot to navigate through cluttered environments more quickly than a standard approach.
In many situations users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed. Depending on the environment and the paths step-by-step following of the human might not be the optimal solution since better paths for the robot exist. We predict where the person will go next and use this information to help the robot move ahead. Since frequent occlusions of the human will occur due to obstacles and the robot's constrained field of view the estimate about the human's position and the prediction of the next destination are affected by uncertainty. Our approach deals with such situations by explicitly considering occlusions in the reward function such that the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its view. We show in simulated and real-world experiments that our technique leads to shorter paths compared to an approach in which the robot always tries to follow the user and can handle occlusions.
An autonomous service robot often first has to search for a user to carry out a desired task. This is a challenging problem especially when this person moves around since the robot’s field of view is constrained and the environment structure typically poses further visibility constraints that influence the perception of the user. In this paper we propose a novel method that estimates the likelihood of seeing the user at each possible location in the environment. The robot takes into account how long it takes to reach each location and the user's visibility. Our experiments in various simulated environments demonstrate that our approach leads to a significantly shorter search time compared to a greedy approach.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots rely on planar regions. Humanoids need height information because they can step over and onto objects. We present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system uses this information to plan paths in real time at low CPU cost. We show that our framework keeps run times under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning.
In this paper a lab automation drone notional concept is introduced Here a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to dexterously manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high throughput systems The resulting drone could augment existing high throughput systems operations A 6-axis arm and gripper that allows for movement in multiple directions The test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given
Robot companionship has become more popular in recent years. However, humanoid robots can be unstable. To improve stability, wheel attachments have been added to some robots. This allows them to move faster and more stably than walking. A robot can switch to rolling when necessary. A robot named DARwIn-OP has been used to test and evaluate robot companionship. This paper discusses using a robot to fetch toys based on voice commands.
In the modern era of automation and robotics autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec We present the same results in this research and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods of vision and learning based navigation With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks we propose an imitation learning based data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot Our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved in the data collection process With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting
Advances in electronics and sensor technology have widened the scope of networked drones. These drones are used for surveillance, video recording, operations, and transportation. Small drones are proving to be useful in civilian applications. They can be used in formations or swarms. A real-time drone formation control can be used to develop display applications.
This study looks at how digital marketing helps small tourism businesses. The study answers the question of how using certain tools benefits a company's abilities. By looking at marketing as a set of skills, the study provides new insights into how tourism businesses use digital marketing. The study found that using certain tools changes how companies market themselves. They can now lead in digital marketing instead of just following it.
The prevalence and rapid development of the Internet and mobile technology in recent decades has revamped our living styles and daily habits. To ride on the digital trend more business activities have been engaged in the digital world. Marketing and advertising is one of typical business areas that is transformed digitally. The rise of Key Opinion Leaders social media platforms and Omni-channel retailing have attracted countless business entities to consider the adoption of digital marketing tools for promoting and advertising their brands and products. However with so many digital marketing tools available they must be carefully selected. A new approach called fuzzy-AHP is developed to help businesses choose the right digital marketing tools for adoption. The developed method not only streamlines the internal business process of digital marketing tool selection but it also increases the practitioner's effectiveness of achieving the pre-defined strategic marketing objectives.
In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely the lack of direct evidence that muscle hypertrophy from exercise plays an important role in increasing strength. To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be primarily contingent on changes in muscle size. Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for maximization of both muscle size and strength. However, the current understanding of the relationship between muscle size and strength is surprising because it's based on limited evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training the loss of muscle mass with detraining yet a maintenance of muscle strength the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training yet divergent results in strength
Low-intensity occlusion training provides a unique beneficial training mode for promoting muscle hypertrophy. Training at low intensities can cause muscle growth in just 3 weeks. An exercise prescription calls for 3 to 5 sets with short rest periods. This is beneficial for those who are unable to sustain high loads due to joint pain postoperative patients cardiac rehabilitation athletes who are unloading and astronauts.
However, most people believe that aerobic exercise has little effect on muscle size. But our research shows that aerobic exercise can actually help build muscle. We have demonstrated that aerobic exercise can help build muscle. These findings provide a new perspective on muscle mass regulation and help us understand how to prevent muscle loss.
Stretch training is widely used in a variety of fitness-related capacities such as increasing joint range of motion, preventing contractures and alleviating injuries. Moreover, some researches indicate that stretch training may induce muscle hypertrophy however studies on the topic have been primarily relegated to animal and in vitro models. The purpose of this brief review was to evaluate whether stretch training is a viable strategy to induce muscle hypertrophy in humans. Of the 10 studies identified 3 observed some significantly positive effects of stretch training on muscle structure. Intriguingly in these studies the stretching was carried out with an apparatus that aided in its performance or with an external overload. 2 out of 5 studies that combined stretching with resistance training showed better muscle growth when the stretching was done during rest periods between exercises. In conclusion passive low-intensity stretch does not appear to confer beneficial changes in muscle size and architecture alternatively when stretching is done with a certain degree of tensile strain particularly when loaded may elicit muscle hypertrophy.
Cycle training is a common part of exercise programs for improving cardiovascular health. Professional cyclists have larger muscle size compared to non-cyclists. This review discusses the effects of cycle training on muscle size and strength of the lower extremity. Cycle training can increase muscle size, but it may take longer than typical resistance training. Cycle training can benefit both young and older adults, but older adults may see greater strength gains.
Resistance training is the most effective method to increase muscle mass. It has also been shown to promote many health benefits. It is considered safe and of clinical relevance for treating and preventing a vast number of diseases a time-efficient and minimal dose of exercise has been the focus of a great number of research studies. Some research suggests a curve-shaped relationship between training dose and its effects but more studies are needed to confirm this. There is a clear relationship between the amount of resistance training and its effects on the body such as muscle growth and overall health. The main idea is that volume is the most important factor to modify as it has a proven effect on muscle growth and overall health.
Although the effects of short versus long rest intervals in resistance training on muscle growth have been investigated in several studies the findings are mixed and unclear. Research shows that both short and long breaks between sets can help build muscle. New research suggests that long rest intervals may be better for building muscle. More research is needed to figure out which approach is best.
Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle where it has a memory that helps it recover faster when it's been strong before but lost its mass. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy the muscle seems to remember how to grow back faster because it has more myonuclei. Muscles that have more myonuclei grow faster when exercised so these muscles remember their previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent protecting them from muscle tissue damage. However myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly and if the long lasting muscle memory also exists in humans one should consider early strength training as a public health advice
It has been hypothesized that eating small frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance. Several studies show that eating often is linked to less body fat. The purpose of this review is to look at the results of several studies that measured the effect of eating frequency on body fat and muscle mass. Eating often reduces body fat and increases muscle mass. However one study's results might not be reliable so we need to be careful when interpreting the findings.

We hypothesized that compared to post-exercise protein intake, co-ingestion of alcohol would down-regulate lower muscle protein production.
Eight healthy physically active male subjects age 21.4±4.8 yr body mass 79.3±11.9 kg peak oxygen uptake 48.1±4.8 mL·kg−1·min−1 leg extension one repetition maximum 104±20 kg who had been participating in regular exercise 3 times a week for more than 6 months volunteered for this study
The study employed a randomized design in which each subject completed bouts of consecutive resistance continuous and intermittent high-intensity exercise with either post-exercise ingestion of alcohol-carbohydrate ALC-CHO alcohol-protein ALC-PRO or protein only PRO beverages on three separate occasions
eight sets of five repetitions at 80% of 1RM
After completion of the final set subjects rested for 5 min before commencing 30 min of continuous cycling at a high level of intensity.
Upon completion subjects rested on the bike for 2 min before undertaking 10×30 s high intensity intervals at 110% of their maximum power output with 30 s active recovery at 50% of their maximum power output between each work bout
After exercise subjects rested for 4 hours before consuming the solution of 25g of protein powder from a company called Musashi in Melbourne, Australia or an energy-match in the form of 25 g maltodextrin.
A CHO-based meal was consumed 2 hours after exercise, immediately after a muscle biopsy, according to recommendations for post-exercise glycogen recovery.
The 8 hour time frame is important after exercise and when blood alcohol levels are high.
The alcohol ingestion protocol began 1 hour post-exercise and was consumed in 6 equal volumes of vodka and orange juice during a 3 hour period.
The focus of the short time after exercise is to enhance physiological processes that are critical for reversing exercise-induced disturbances and for promoting adaptations to training [1]
orange juice was consumed with water in place of alcohol
Subjects ingested the beverages every 30 minutes.
Blood cell signaling and mRNA data were analyzed. Myofibrillar protein synthesis was also analyzed.
The first novel finding of this study was that exercise and protein synthesis were impaired by the ingestion of large amounts of alcohol after intense exercise.
When drunk, athletes are less likely to follow recovery practices. This leads to a big drop in their performance.
However, consuming alcohol after consuming protein in amounts that stimulate muscle protein synthesis during recovery reduces muscle protein synthesis by about 24%, only partially rescuing the muscle-building response compared with protein alone.
The mechanistic target of mTORC1 is a central node for integrating nutrient and exercise signal transduction.
the current data provide that alcohol impairs the response of muscle in exercise recovery
alcohol consumed was based on reports of binge drinking
Some reports suggest intakes of some individuals can be significantly greater which is of concern for many reasons related to health and safety
Good nutrition helps with muscle recovery in muscles. Eat protein and carbohydrates.
It's hard to find information about how drinking affects sports performance that has resonance with athletes.
Given the need to promote protein synthesis that helps repair muscle tissue the results of the current study provide clear evidence of impaired recovery when alcohol is consumed after high-intensity exercise even in the presence of optimal nutritional conditions.
We propose our data is of great interest to athletes and coaches.
A message of moderation in alcohol intake helps recovery after exercise with the potential to alter current sports culture and athlete practices.
Muscle contraction and the intake of leucine-rich protein sources activate two separate signals that work together, which then converge at the mechanistic target of rapamycin, leading to increased protein production in muscles.
The ingestion of about 20-25 grams of protein soon after exercise repeated every 4 hours has been shown to maximise the anabolic response in skeletal muscle.
The cultural environment surrounding some sports often involves the intake of large amounts of alcohol after training and competition with athletes being at risk of excessive drinking.
Binge drinking after exercise is likely to include the direct effect of alcohol on the body as well as the indirect effect on recovery due to not eating or resting adequately.
The concurrent consumption of carbs can offset some of the negative effects of alcohol on muscle recovery after exercise. However, the effect of alcohol on muscle protein synthesis is unknown.
The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of alcohol intake on cell signaling and protein production in humans during recovery from a bout of strenuous exercise approximating stresses an athlete may experience in training and performance for various team sports such as various football and rugby codes and court sports.
Human aging causes changes to skeletal muscle. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass in older adults. Resistance training can help reduce muscle loss and improve mobility. \n\nResistance training can also improve balance and reduce the risk of falls. Older adults should participate in regular exercise, such as walking or resistance training, to stay mobile.


Exercise is becoming a key tool in treating and preventing medical conditions like arthritis and diabetes. It has many health benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure, and improving physical strength and functioning. Many people with kidney disease can benefit from exercise, and it should be a part of their treatment plan.
Blood flow restriction is an effective way to increase strength in healthy people. However, its effects on pain and function in people with knee pain are unknown. Objective: To determine if adding blood flow restriction to resistance exercise can help with pain relief and improve function in people with knee pain. \n\nResearch was done to compare resistance exercise with and without blood flow restriction in people over 18 with knee pain. The results showed that resistance exercise with blood flow restriction was not more effective than resistance exercise alone for reducing pain and improving knee function in people with knee pain.
In Japan there were an estimated 43 million patients with hypertension in 2010 The management of this condition is given the highest priority in disease control and the importance of lifestyle changes for the prevention and treatment of hypertension has been recognized in Japan In particular emphasis has been placed on increasing the levels of activities of daily living and physical exercise sports In this literature review we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension as described in Japanese and foreign articles This review recommends safe and effective aerobic exercise at a moderate intensity for 30-60 minutes 3-4 times a week focusing on major muscle groups to prevent and treat hypertension Resistance exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise but resistance exercise is contraindicated in patients with hypertension who have chest symptoms such as chest pain
Physical activity has been shown to be a good way to prevent many diseases and improve overall health. It's often advised to start strength training late, but there's no strong evidence to support this. Many studies have found that strength training is safe and healthy for children and adolescents when done properly. This includes getting medical clearance and following instructions from a qualified professional. Starting strength training early can help improve motor skills and body composition, such as building muscle and bone health.
there has been a renewed public interest in IFast \nGiven the importance of nutrition in athletic performance there is a concern about the effects of IFast on athletics \nThe results of the studies were mixed but most found that fasting does not improve athletic performance while fasting Looking at high intensity endurance and resistance exercises studies have been uniform in showing that there is no benefit to athletic performance while fasting
Nearly every physically active person encounters periods in which the time available for exercise is limited eg personal family or business conflicts During such periods the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain rather than improve physical performance Similarly certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods especially athletes and military personnel In general populations endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks with reduced training frequency or volume as long as the exercise intensity is maintained Strength and muscle size can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with as little as 1 session of strength training per week and 1 set per exercise as long as the exercise intensity is maintained whereas in older populations maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 sessions per week and 2–3 sets per exercise while maintaining exercise intensity Our primary conclusion is that exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time despite relatively large reductions in exercise frequency and volume
Nutrient timing is a nutritional strategy that involves consuming protein and carbohydrates in and around an exercise session. This approach can improve body composition. The post-exercise period is the most critical part of nutrient timing. Consuming the right nutrients during this time helps rebuild muscle tissue and restore energy reserves. Some researchers have mentioned an anabolic window after training where adaptations can be optimized. However, the importance of this window can vary.
Lack of time is among the more commonly reported barriers for abstention from exercise programs\nThe aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be most effectively carried out in a time-efficient manner by We looked at the latest studies on how to train effectively in less time and found that focusing on a few key exercises is the best way to achieve this\nWhen programming strength training for optimum time-efficiency we recommend prioritizing bilateral multi-joint exercises that include full dynamic movements and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise and one upper-body pulling exercise and one upper-body pushing exercise\nExercises can be performed with machines and or free weights based on training goals availability and personal preferences\nWeekly training volume is more important than training frequency We recommend performing a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group\nAdvanced training techniques like supersets and rest-pause training can save time without reducing the amount of work done\nHowever these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects\nFinally we advise restricting the warm-up to exercise-specific warm-ups and only prioritize stretching if the goal of training is to increase flexibility
Training frequency is an important variable in the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the effects of weekly training frequency on muscle growth. Results showed no significant difference between higher and lower frequency. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not impact muscle growth when the amount of exercise is the same.
Specialized training techniques have been shown to help build muscle. Specialized training techniques such as drop sets and supersets are thought to help with muscle growth. This article will look at how these techniques can help build muscle and explore ways to apply them in workouts.
The quest to increase lean body mass is widely pursued by those who lift weights. Research is lacking on the best approach for muscle growth. Bodybuilders train with moderate loads and short rest intervals, while powerlifters train with high-intensity loads and long rest periods. Both groups display impressive muscularity, but it's not clear which method is best for muscle growth. Many factors contribute to muscle growth, including mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress. This paper reviews the literature on muscle growth and exercise training to draw conclusions on the best protocol for maximizing muscle growth.
