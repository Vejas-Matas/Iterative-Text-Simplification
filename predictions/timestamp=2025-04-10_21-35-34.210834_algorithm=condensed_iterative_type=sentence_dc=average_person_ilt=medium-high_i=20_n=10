Cars are being studied.
Drones in public should be able to fly by itself. The passage is hard to understand.
Because of drone rules, is well-liked.
We're trying to make a system to help drones be flown by a good pilot
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a powerful computer model that checks for roads in images. It's a simple tool
Our system does well in terms of speed and copying one model.
The data was captured by experts who have a lot of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from officials who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process.
We have been driven successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting.
The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at very fast speeds up to 6 meters per second.
