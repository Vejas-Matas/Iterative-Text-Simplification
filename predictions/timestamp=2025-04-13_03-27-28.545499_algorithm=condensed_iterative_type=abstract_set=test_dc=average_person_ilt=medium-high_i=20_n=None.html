                  <div class="text-muted">Perception of the environment is <strong> necessary</strong> for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most <strong> robots (humanoids</strong> and wheeled <strong> robots)</strong> rely on planar regions. For <strong> humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics),</strong> a 2D map is not sufficient <strong> because</strong> they can step over and onto <strong> objects, so they</strong> need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> bring</strong> another level of complexity, <strong> because it</strong> can lead to necessary replanning or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low <strong> processor</strong> cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

In conclusion, although the initial results suggest a potential benefit of increased <strong> eating</strong> frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be <strong>carefully interpreted.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Small screens</strong> and <strong> low resolutions</strong> on mobile devices <strong> are a major obstacle for</strong> the <strong> widespread adoption</strong> of web applications in a wireless environment. <strong> PDA screens</strong> are often too <strong> small</strong> to <strong> display entire web pages. Low-resolution devices like WebTV face the</strong> same <strong> problem. Manually reconstructing</strong> web pages for these devices would <strong> help, but</strong> the <strong> wide range</strong> of display capabilities <strong> would make it challenging for</strong> web page designers <strong> as</strong> they <strong> would</strong> have to customize <strong> each</strong> web page for <strong> every</strong> possible display <strong> device, increasing their workload. This paper suggests</strong> a <strong> system for segmenting</strong> and <strong> presenting documents.</strong> The system divides a web document into logical segments <strong> automatically, using information about</strong> the screen <strong> size, document structure,</strong> and <strong> content. The system also extracts summaries</strong> and overviews to <strong> make navigation easier.</strong> The system <strong> optimizes</strong> the use of the screen for information <strong>finding by showing the segments and structure of a web document.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">In recent years, we have <strong> created</strong> applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking. These applications <strong> are designed</strong> for the Cybiko personal digital assistant, <strong> which offers a cost-effective</strong> alternative to other <strong> hardware options. The</strong> Cybiko PDA was <strong> discontinued recently. Consequently,</strong> these applications <strong> needed</strong> to be <strong> adapted</strong> to other platforms to <strong> maintain their usefulness. To avoid the time-consuming task</strong> of porting each application to <strong> various platforms due</strong> to <strong> different APIs</strong> and networking protocols, we <strong> developed</strong> the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer <strong> simplifies</strong> the Cybiko networking structure and interface, <strong> making it easier to adapt</strong> Cybiko applications to <strong> different platforms without needing</strong> to <strong>make significant changes to the code.</strong></div>

It involves identifying</strong> the cells <strong> that help muscles grow.</strong> Even if <strong> muscles shrink,</strong> the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. <strong> Muscles</strong> that have <strong> been exercised before can gain strength</strong> faster when <strong>exercised again.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, <strong> it</strong> has been <strong> said</strong> that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in <strong> muscles</strong> in which <strong> muscle growth</strong> is <strong> 'remembered'</strong> such that a fibre that has lost its mass, can regain <strong> it</strong> faster than <strong> untrained</strong> fibres. A new <strong> model,</strong> with the most reliable methods for identifying <strong> myonuclei (nuclei in muscle fiber),</strong> can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells <strong> (quiescent cells acting as a reserve population of cells for regeneration of muscle)</strong> before <strong> muscle</strong> growth. Even <strong> after</strong> grave <strong> muscle loss,</strong> the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against <strong> programmed cell death</strong> observed <strong> during</strong> muscle <strong> loss.</strong> Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster <strong> during strength</strong> exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important <strong> 'memory'</strong> of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit <strong> for old people,</strong> and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice. <strong></strong></div>

It involves identifying</strong> the cells <strong> that help muscles grow.</strong> Even if <strong> muscles shrink,</strong> the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. <strong> Muscles</strong> that have <strong> been exercised before can gain strength</strong> faster when <strong>exercised again.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, <strong> it</strong> has been <strong> said</strong> that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in <strong> muscles</strong> in which <strong> muscle growth</strong> is <strong> 'remembered'</strong> such that a fibre that has lost its mass, can regain <strong> it</strong> faster than <strong> untrained</strong> fibres. A new <strong> model,</strong> with the most reliable methods for identifying <strong> myonuclei (nuclei in muscle fiber),</strong> can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells <strong> (quiescent cells acting as a reserve population of cells for regeneration of muscle)</strong> before <strong> muscle</strong> growth. Even <strong> after</strong> grave <strong> muscle loss,</strong> the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against <strong> programmed cell death</strong> observed <strong> during</strong> muscle <strong> loss.</strong> Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster <strong> during strength</strong> exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important <strong> 'memory'</strong> of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit <strong> for old people,</strong> and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice. <strong></strong></div>
