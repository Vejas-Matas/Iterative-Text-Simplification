In the modern era of automation and robotics, driverless cars are the focus of research.
More and more drones are being used in non-military and commercial areas. There is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a computer model, that evaluates the presence of roads using input frames from different angles.
Based on the Specialized computer model architecture, our system performs better in terms of accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experienced pilots, with several years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from officials who ensured minimal risk to pedestrians during data collection process.
We have navigated roads safely, with the data we collected.
The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6 kilometers per hour.
