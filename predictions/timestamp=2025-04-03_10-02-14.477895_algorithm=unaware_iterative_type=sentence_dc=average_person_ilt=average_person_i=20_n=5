In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of drones, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, real-time tracking along roads is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning approach to help drones navigate city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from classic image classification algorithms, our classifier is based on an Inception model that evaluates the presence of roads using the input frames.
