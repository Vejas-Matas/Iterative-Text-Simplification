In the modern era of technology, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments concerning the height limits of civilian drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an AI-based learning system to driving drones through cities by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered model that uses reconstructed images to detect roads.
