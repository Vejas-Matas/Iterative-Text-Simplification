Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information. <strong> Considering dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> introduces another level of complexity, since they</strong> can <strong> lead to necessary replanning</strong> or <strong> collisions at later stages.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps <strong> for</strong> better weight maintenance. Several studies support this hypothesis, with <strong> a link</strong> between the frequency of eating and <strong> being overweight. This</strong> review <strong> aims</strong> to present and discuss a research on meal frequency with respect to changes in <strong> body</strong> mass. <strong> Eating</strong> frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and <strong> increasing</strong> in fat-free mass. However, the positive findings were the product of a single study, <strong> leaving a</strong> doubt <strong> about the beneficial effect of</strong> frequent meals on body composition. In conclusion, although the initial results suggest a potential benefit of increased <strong> eating</strong> frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be <strong>carefully interpreted.</strong></div>

This paper presents</strong> a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid <strong> robots. On/off</strong> state of the motor is <strong> used to find</strong> relevant input features. <strong> Bottleneck features</strong> have been successfully applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR) <strong> systems based on deep neural networks (DNN). The</strong> motor on/off state data <strong> and</strong> acoustic features <strong> are used</strong> as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling. <strong> The</strong> second DNN for primary acoustic modeling <strong> uses</strong> both bottleneck features from the first DNN and <strong> acoustic ones. The</strong> proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, experimental results show that improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems. <strong></strong></div>

Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information. <strong> Considering dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> introduces another level of complexity, since they</strong> can <strong> lead to necessary replanning</strong> or <strong> collisions at later stages.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> require the robot to plan its path again, which</strong> can <strong> cause delays</strong> or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, <strong> it</strong> has been <strong> said</strong> that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in <strong> muscles</strong> in which <strong> muscle growth</strong> is <strong> 'remembered'</strong> such that a fibre that has lost its mass, can regain <strong> it</strong> faster than <strong> untrained</strong> fibres. A new <strong> model,</strong> with the most reliable methods for identifying <strong> myonuclei (nuclei in muscle fiber),</strong> can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells <strong> (quiescent cells acting as a reserve population of cells for regeneration of muscle)</strong> before <strong> muscle</strong> growth. Even <strong> after</strong> grave <strong> muscle loss,</strong> the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against <strong> programmed cell death</strong> observed <strong> during</strong> muscle <strong> loss.</strong> Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster <strong> during strength</strong> exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important <strong> 'memory'</strong> of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit <strong> for old people,</strong> and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice. <strong></strong></div>

To respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, algorithms <strong> are used</strong> to detect phishing websites based on their content, employing a data set consisting of 17,992 phishing attacks targeting 159 different brands.
