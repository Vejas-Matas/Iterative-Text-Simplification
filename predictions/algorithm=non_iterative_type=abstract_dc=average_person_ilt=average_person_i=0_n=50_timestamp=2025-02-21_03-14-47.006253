A new mobile app helps with wildfires by giving users easy access to information and tools to coordinate with others. The app is used by firefighters in Greece and is a companion to a larger web-based system called AEGIS. It allows users to find the closest firefighting resources and see important data like weather and water sources. The app can also be controlled by voice commands thanks to a digital assistant named Cortana.
Mobile technology has been applied in education and some mobile devices include personal digital assistants smart phones and e-books. These devices can be used in combination with wireless networks to provide new learning experiences for students. Research has shown that mobile learning is a meaningful way to improve student learning and interaction with the environment. Using mobile devices with suitable learning methods can enhance student learning and is an important issue in education. This study investigated the learning achievement and attitude of elementary school students using mobile devices and competitive learning strategies. The results showed that students who used competitive learning strategies performed better than those who did not. Both groups showed a positive attitude towards learning after the activity.
A wireless patient monitoring system was developed to track a patient's health. It uses a device that can send ECG signals to a local server through Bluetooth. The system includes devices for different users such as doctors and patients. This system allows patients and doctors to be more mobile and flexible which improves the quality of care and the patient's lifestyle.
As people use more devices that show images like high-resolution printers and small display screens on mobile phones the need for high-quality image enlargement has grown. This paper presents a new way to enlarge images while keeping them clear. A major issue with image enlargement is that it makes edges look jagged. To fix this problem we propose a new method that uses a computer algorithm to determine the best values for the new pixels.
Many people have trouble seeing colours. Everyday tasks become hard for them. We created a device to help. It turns everyday scenes into sound for people who can't see. The device takes a picture and breaks it down into different colours. It then sends the colours as sound through headphones. The user can also give feedback to make the device better. This will be possible in the future as technology improves.
A medicine decision support system in a mobile device can help prevent medication mistakes in the elderly. It shows a list of the patient's medicines and warns against bad combinations. We tested this system with nurses who care for patients at home. They found it helpful and easy to use. The system showed them potential problems with the patient's medicines and suggested safer alternatives. The nurses thought it would be a useful tool for their work.
Many large healthcare organizations use systems to manage their appointment schedules but these systems are not easily accessible by clinicians. Staff other than the clinician's assistant may manage scheduling making it hard for clinicians to stay informed of changes. Some clinicians use personal digital assistants to keep track of their schedules but these devices often lack access to the full schedule information.
Partners In Health and its sister organization in Peru, Socios En Salud, treat most patients with a hard to cure disease called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. To track the disease, they collect data from health centers across the city. Instead of sending someone to collect the information by hand, they created a digital system to collect and upload the data. \n\nIn a test, they compared the new system to the old way of doing things. The digital system was faster and made fewer mistakes. Users liked it and it saved time, which means the cost will be paid back in just three months.
To make it easier for doctors and nurses to communicate with each other and share knowledge, a team of researchers created a tool for cardiac patients. This tool was tested at a hospital where nurses work with doctors to diagnose patients with chest pain. The tool helped nurses with and without experience in cardiac care, and it worked well in a team environment.
This paper presents a mobile language learning tool for Korean language learners called M-CALL. To make learning more engaging it includes a fun cyber pet game. The system uses a handheld device and a wireless internet connection to allow learning anywhere. As learners solve language learning problems the cyber pet grows. The tool uses real Korean language tests to set the difficulty level. It includes various features for learning the Korean language. A working version of M-CALL has been created and is being tested on a handheld device and a computer.
People used two types of keyboards with a stylus to type on a handheld computer screen. They typed as fast and accurately as they could into a digital assistant. The QWERTY keyboard allowed them to type faster than the T9 keyboard despite the T9 being easier to use physically. The T9 layout was harder to use because it took longer to look at the letters on the keys. This means the QWERTY keyboard is still the best design for typing on soft keyboards with a stylus.
The rise of smartphones and personal digital assistants opened new ways for mobile shopping. These systems have similar components to standard online shopping apps but also come with unique challenges. For example, mobile devices have limited screens and processing power. This means software development is different from desktop applications. We need to consider what users want to access with their phones and how to provide useful apps with limited input options. Testing these systems is also a challenge. We'll discuss some of these issues based on our experience with a mobile app for booking hotel rooms.
We need to make web content suitable for mobile devices because they have limited capabilities. Since different mobile devices have different capabilities we should adapt content for each one. There are two common ways to adapt content: automated conversion and explicitly specifying the adapted content. However these methods have a trade-off between quality and the effort to develop and maintain them. We propose a simple way to adapt content that avoids this trade-off. We use a model called WebComposition and its XML-based implementation WCML to make this possible. We applied this approach to a real application to show how it can reduce the effort needed to develop and maintain content for different devices.
A device has been designed to monitor patients with heart problems in real time using Body Area Networks. The device is small and comfortable for patients to wear. It can send data about the patient's heart rate and temperature to a doctor's phone. The data is stored and processed in a way that doesn't overload the communication network. A prototype has been made to test this system and it can send ECG signals and body temperature. The device uses Bluetooth to communicate with a phone and a computer system stores the data in a patient database.
Wireless technology has improved learning in many ways. Now people use mobile devices like smartphones to learn in different settings. These devices can connect to the internet and share information with their surroundings. A system called One Day Trip helps students learn a new language in real-life situations using a mobile device. This system uses a concept called Knowledge Management to make learning easier for teachers and students.
We developed apps for wired and wireless networking. These apps were made for the Cybiko personal digital assistant but it was discontinued. We had to move them to other devices. Instead of changing each app for each new device which would be very time-consuming we created a layer that makes it easy to move apps to different devices.
We need a way for smartcards to communicate securely with their owners. Without this, their useful properties are hard to use. We're exploring the boundary between smartcards and more powerful machines. On the other side of this boundary we find the Personal Digital Assistant. To be useful, a machine must be able to create trustworthy digital signatures and have enough functionality and resources. A smartcard alone cannot create trustworthy digital signatures because the user does not know what information is being put onto the card. To make a smartcard trustworthy, it must be supported by some external infrastructure. We're looking into what needs to be included in this infrastructure, and we've found that digital signatures can be made using standard methods. This means we can create nontrivial systems using smartcards, where smartcard holders are treated as equals. If a smartcard can be trusted, it opens up new opportunities for user-centered design.
We present a new tele-assistance system for elderly people that provides high quality assistance anywhere and at any time. It monitors vital signs and detects anomalies in real time and sends alerts automatically. The system offers three main features: assistance anywhere and at any time, monitoring of vital signs, and remote monitoring by authorized people through the internet.
Participants who used a handheld computer program to help them prescribe pain medication made fewer mistakes than those who didn't use the program. The program gave them guidance on how to assess a patient's risk for stomach problems from the medication.
Pedestrian navigation is similar to car navigation and many researchers have studied it. Three-dimensional maps are useful for city and landscape planning and other engineering fields. They provide more information than two-dimensional maps. This paper proposes pedestrian navigation using three-dimensional maps and discusses the required technologies and situations where they can be used. We also compare the effectiveness of two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps in navigation. We did experiments where we searched for objects using maps with and without textures on different devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. The results show that three-dimensional maps with textures on mobile phones and three-dimensional maps without textures on PDAs are better than two-dimensional maps in search time and error rate.
Mobile agents are a way of using computers in mobile environments with slow internet connections. They can be used to find and filter information and return only what's needed. These agents are like small programs that are created on a mobile device and go onto the internet to complete tasks. They can use email as a way to send and receive information. This paper explains Active M3 which is a tool that lets people create mobile agents in a visual way.
DVB-H is a technology that lets phones and PDAs get digital TV signals. This paper looks at how to get digital TV on mobile devices. It explains the DVB-H standard and how it works on a technical level.
A low-cost device was designed using the IDT RV4640 processor to achieve high speed communications. The device can be used for various purposes such as video calls and internet access. The processor is a 64-bit RISC chip that executes instructions quickly. The device also includes a network interface card that allows for fast data transfer and costs under $100.
Dr Who is a Microsoft project that helps people interact with their devices using voice commands. It's a new way to use personal digital assistants like PDAs. Dr Who uses speech recognition and voice commands to let users do things like writing emails or texts without having to type. This makes it easier to use these devices. The device has a built-in microphone and a touch screen that helps the system understand what the user is saying. The system uses a computer to recognize speech and understand what the user wants to do.
Research in the sociology of technology shows how new mobile applications come to be in complex commercial environments is not well understood. The process involves social interaction between groups that try to agree on what mobile technology problems are and how to solve them. This is shown in the early days of the personal digital assistant. Established groups try to tell new players what the main problems and solutions are which forces the new players to completely redefine the new application.
We created a system that helps people access the web on their mobile devices like phones or tablets. This system takes web content and converts it into a format that is easy to view on these devices. We use images and text from the web and turn them into a multimedia format that works well on mobile devices. The way web content looks on mobile devices is similar to how it looks on computers but there are some differences due to the device's screen resolution and sound quality. When people switch from interactive to passive viewing on their devices the presentation also needs to change. We developed a method to adjust the way web content is presented on different devices. We use keywords to represent the emotional tone of a web page by changing the background color and use a special font to highlight the main subject. We also break down images into smaller parts and show them one by one with visual effects. This method works on any type of device.
We developed a system called "The Beijing Explorer" which shares users' locations in real time using a PDA with a GPS receiver and wireless LAN. Users can see their location and chat with others on the PDA screen in real time. We tested the system in Beijing's Palace Museum and found that sharing location data and information was helpful and interesting. Accurate location information is key for the guidance system.
Personal machines like Personal Digital Assistants are different from regular machines because they are personal and private. They are designed to work even when there's a network or power failure. This means that systems should be designed to treat these personal machines as important parts of the system. The goal is to keep the user in control of their personal data and assets like money and passwords.
Depression is often not recognized in kids and teenagers. A new tool was made to help nurses identify depression in children and teenagers aged 8 to 18 using a personal digital assistant. The tool was tested by nurse students and showed some promising results. Only about one-third of children who could be screened were actually screened. About 20% of those who were screened were found to be at risk for a mood disorder. The main reasons for not screening children included lack of time and knowledge about how to do it.
This study looked into how wireless technology can improve patient care and education. Researchers searched through medical databases and observed the use of mobile devices by healthcare professionals and students. Many now use personal digital assistants and this number is expected to grow. Wireless technology can connect these devices to the internet and networks. It has the potential to save time in patient care and improve overall care efficiency and patient satisfaction.
Nursing students can learn many things through hands-on training with real medical practices and patients. Practical training is an effective way for students to develop their nursing skills. However, hospitals can't use electrical devices for learning due to safety concerns. We created a digital tool to help students imagine and practice nursing techniques anywhere, anytime using a portable device. We developed an educational resource called the "digital nursing dictionary" and tested its effectiveness.
Mobile devices have a small screen size and low resolution which makes it hard to view web pages. Web pages are too big for small screens like those on PDAs or low-resolution devices like WebTV. To solve this problem web pages could be broken into smaller parts but this would be very difficult for web designers because they would have to customize each page for many different devices. This paper proposes a system that divides web pages into smaller parts based on the screen size and the type of content. The system also adds summaries and overviews to help users navigate the page and make the most of the screen.
A device was built using a small computer chip called the C8051F005. It monitors voltage and can use an algorithm to analyze the data. The device has two modes and can send the information to a central location using different methods such as a phone line or a special card.
Users can access information online from anywhere with devices like smartphones and tablets. We studied how people switch from using large screens like computers to small screens like personal digital assistants. We looked at three ways to display web pages on small screens: Direct Migration, Linear, and Overview. We found a new method called Gateway that helps users navigate web pages on small screens, based on what they already know. In our study, people preferred using the Gateway and Direct Migration methods for web pages they were already familiar with.
Mobile systems have limitations that need to be considered during software development. We have developed a system to categorize potential risks and applied it to a device that helps with negotiations for a personal digital assistant. We plan to study how to better combine existing risk management techniques with a flexible development method.
Speaker recognition is a biometric technology that is simple cheap and convenient. It's used for authentication and a lot of research is being done on it. This paper presents a system that can recognise voices from multiple channels. A large collection of voices from different devices was used to test the system.
In this paper a method is presented to generate random pseudonyms in a network. Each user can now generate a pseudonym on their personal device without sharing information with others except for a unique code. The user can also prove they created a specific pseudonym without revealing their identity and show their identity by revealing the pseudonym.
In today's mobile society location-based services are very important. People use their mobile devices to access maps, plan routes, get directions, and traffic information. Since mobile devices don't have as much power or storage as computers, special methods were developed to help. This paper shares the experience of creating a route planner for public transport on a personal digital assistant. Breaking the route calculation into smaller steps helps make it work on the mobile device.
DIANE is a digital assistant system that helps doctors quickly access hospital information like medical records and staff data.
Digital assistants are becoming more common in our daily lives. Users interact with them to do multiple tasks at once.
Individuals make decisions based on biases. Our research looks at how managers' biases affect their companies' performance when they make decisions together. We tested different scenarios and found that some biases can actually help a company when combined, but hurt it when used alone.
Big data helps many areas like marketing, healthcare, and national security. However, it also raises concerns about privacy and fairness. As machines make decisions without human oversight, we need to consider the ethics of using and analyzing data. Policymakers should create guidelines for fair data use and protection. This would help prevent misuse of data and give people more control over their information.
We studied how people use a smart speaker called Google Home. We tested it with 20 people who speak English well and 20 people who don't speak English as their first language. The people who speak English well liked the Google Home more than those who don't. Our study shows that how well someone speaks English affects how well they can use a voice assistant. This can help designers make better voice assistants for people who don't speak English well.
We need a way to tell if a smart speaker is receiving voice commands from a human or a machine. To prevent someone from sending fake voice commands to a smart speaker when no one is home we propose a system that includes a speaker and a microphone.
People are getting used to talking to smart speakers but sometimes they still get errors like "cannot understand" or "no audio resource". When this happens it's good for the smart speaker to give a helpful and proper response. We looked at how people like different responses from smart speakers in two situations where they get an error. We found that people were happier and thought the speaker was more sincere when it apologized. When the speaker couldn't find the music someone asked for, using humor did not make a big difference. But when the speaker couldn't understand what was said, using humor actually made people think the speaker was less sincere.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to look at different types of compounds that could be used in drug discovery. The results showed that certain types of compounds were very different from others. This could help us decide which compounds to use in drug discovery and make it more likely to find a successful drug.
Bioassay protocols can be made machine-readable by using special vocabulary. However, the way scientists write these protocols makes them hard for computers to analyze. By using a detailed list of terms, we can express the necessary information in a way that computers can understand. This allows us to search, group and evaluate experiments in various ways. The BioAssay Ontology is a tool that helps with this by providing a list of meaningful terms that can be linked to.
Bioinformaticians face a big challenge when dealing with the huge datasets produced by next generation sequencing Next generation sequencing produces massive datasets and bioinformaticians have to use many different tools to analyze them These tools only do one step at a time so bioinformaticians have to put them together and manage the data and information to get the final result
A computer program called SPSS was used to look for patterns between traditional Chinese medicine and symptoms, syndromes, and causes of illness.
Identifying bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics is important for public health and food safety. New technology called next-generation sequencing can help identify the genetic differences in bacteria.
