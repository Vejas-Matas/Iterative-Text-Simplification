In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
Drones being used in everyday life and business, drones are increasingly being used in both civilian and commercial activities, so they need to be more autonomous.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning-based system for controlling drones in urban areas by mimicking an experienced pilot, using a computer-controlled drone navigation system.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a multi-layered neural network model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
