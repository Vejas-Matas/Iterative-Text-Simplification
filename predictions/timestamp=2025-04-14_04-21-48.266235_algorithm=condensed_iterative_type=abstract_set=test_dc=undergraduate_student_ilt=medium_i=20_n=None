Eating 20-25 grams of protein after exercise has been shown to maximise the anabolic response in skeletal muscle.
However, a second finding was that even when protein was consumed in amounts that help build muscle, the intake of alcohol reduced muscle protein synthesis by 24%, but it didn't fully restore muscle growth.
Anti-phishing tools can detect phishing websites accurately. Some can achieve a high detection rate.
It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps to achieve better weight maintenance. Several observational studies lend support to this hypothesis, with an inverse relationship noted between the frequency of eating and adiposity. We studied how eating more often affects body fat and muscle mass. Eating more often was linked to a decrease in body fat and an increase in muscle mass. One study's results are uncertain, which makes it hard to know if eating more often really helps with body composition. The initial results suggest that eating more often may improve body composition, but the findings are uncertain and need more research.
They drank the beverage every 30 minutes, taking 5 minutes to do so.
The focus of the early post-exercise period (i.e., 1â€“8 h) is to enhance physiological processes that are critical for reversing the exercise-induced disturbances to homeostasis and physiological function and for promoting adaptations to training [1].
Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. We conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including native English and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker. The study's findings can help designers and developers improve VUIs for people with different languages and better voice recognition. The findings show that native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device. It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs.

Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Myonuclei are protected against atrophy and death in muscle tissue, allowing them to be retained even if the muscle shrinks. Fibres with more myonuclei grow faster when overloaded, making them more efficient. Myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice, this memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent.
Automated decision-making raises concerns about moral responsibility, with applications like self-driving cars and kidney exchanges.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a 2D map is not enough. They need to know the height of objects to avoid collisions. Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages. In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system creates maps that help plan paths quickly without using too much computer power. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning.
As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy. In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features. For this, we consider a speech recognition system. We first use the motor's on/off state to help the system understand the speech better. The second system uses sound features to recognize speech. When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that an obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process. Significant differences were observed between the pharmacophore profiles obtained for the drug molecules and those obtained for the high-throughput screening compounds, These compounds have similar patterns to nondrug molecules. Pharmacophore profiles help find good medicines. Pharmacophore profiles help find better compounds, leading to more successful leads.
The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation. Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it might improve the health of individuals and communities, and, if successful, might be seen as a public good. However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. The present discourse on moral obligations of future generations, although not referring to women, seems to imply that women might be required, morally, if not legally, to reproduce with IVF. Remarkably, the necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been discussed by its proponents. These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men. Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed. Despite the lack of a unified feminist conclusion in the discussions about the merits and risks of human genome modification, there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
Limitation in display size and resolution on mobile devices is one of the main obstacles for wide-spread use of web applications in a wireless environment. Web pages are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV. However, web designers would need to customize web pages for each device, which is a big task. In this paper, we propose a document segmentation and presentation system. The system automatically divides a web document into a number of logical segments based on the screen size and the structure and content of the document. Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation. The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding.

Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems. These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS). The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.
