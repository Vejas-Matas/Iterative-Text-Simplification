In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of drones getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a machine learning-based solution to UAV autonomy for flying through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a deep neural network model, that evaluates the presence of roads using specialized medical images.
Our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning using neural network.
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone itself, by flying it in city streets, by experts having several years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk to pedestrians is involved.
With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
MAVNet's efficiency allows the drone to fly at high speeds.
