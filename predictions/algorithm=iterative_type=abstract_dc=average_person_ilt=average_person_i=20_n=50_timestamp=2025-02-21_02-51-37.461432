This paper proposes an electrophysiological wireless patient monitoring system which integrates a Wireless ECG signal transmitter, GPS device and a mobile phone to acquire physiological signals and transmit them to a local server via Bluetooth wireless technology. Four types of monitor units were designed for wireless communication: a control center, a local monitor, mobile devices, and a web page for patients and doctors. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient.
As various kinds of output devices emerged such as high-resolution printers or a display of PDA(Personal Digital Assistant) the importance of high-quality resolution conversion has been increasing. This paper proposes a new method for enlarging image with high quality. One of the largest problems on image enlargement is the jaggy edges become distorted. To remedy this problem we propose a new interpolation method which uses a special computer algorithm to determine the best values for the new pixels. The experimental results are shown and evaluated. The effectiveness of our methods is discussed by comparing with the conventional methods.
A significative percentage of the human population suffer from impairments in their capacity to distinguish or even see colours. For them everyday tasks becomes demanding. We present a novel technique for extracting colour information from everyday natural stimuli and presenting it to visually impaired users as pleasant non-invasive sound. This technique was implemented inside a Personal Digital Assistant portable device. Colour information is extracted from images and grouped into categories based on how people perceive colours. This information is subsequently converted into sound and sent to the user via speakers or headphones. In the original implementation it is possible for the user to send its feedback to reconfigure the system however several features such as these were not implemented because the current technology is limited We are confident that the full implementation will be possible in the near future as PDA technology improves.
Inappropriate use of medicines increases the risk of hospital admissions for the elderly. Not only does this lead to unnecessary suffering for the patients but also incurs a great financial cost to the society. A medicine decision support system in a PDA with a barcode reader helps patients and healthcare workers keep track of medicines and prevent bad interactions. Focusing on the elderly our aim was to evaluate if a mobile medicine decision support system with a barcode reader is useful and user-friendly for nurses in home care. The participants received a comprehensive overview from the patients medicine use and noted drug-drug interactions therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people. Our findings show that most nurses found the system useful and easy to use. The nurses regarded that the decision support system increased prevention and safety was useful and user-friendly. Therefore this decision support system might be a useful tool for district nurses.
access to patient appointment schedules can help clinicians manage time and problems better. Many healthcare organizations use complex scheduling systems that are hard for clinicians to access. Also staff other than the clinician's personal assistant(s) may manage scheduling making it difficult for clinicians to stay informed of changes. Many a clinician today uses a personal digital assistant containing basic calendaring functionality Our “PalmOversite” project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating enterprise appointment schedule information into a PDA calendar making schedule information much more readily available to the clinician.
Partners In Health and its sister organization in Lima Peru Socios En Salud treat a majority of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis MDR-TB patients in Peru in conjunction with the Peruvian National TB Program NTP Monthly bacteriology tests which must be collected from health establishments located across this major city are an integral part of this treatment Currently a SES employee visits each health establishment to collect this information by hand process it and type it into an electronic medical record system paper we describe the development and implementation of a personal digital assistant PDA-based electronic system to collect verify and upload monthly bacteriology data into the PIH-EMR After an initial implementation period we conducted a baseline assessment in two areas and then introduced the electronic system in one of them while the other area continued with the old system during the same period We performed a pilot study to test the use of this system The PDA-based system processed data in 6.2 days which was significantly faster than the baseline 54.8 days and control 64.4 days It was also able to reduce the frequency of discrepancy from 10.1 to 2.8 and receive positive feedback from the users Finally the system’s cost would be recuperated in three months from time savings due to increased work efficiency This system will be the subject of a larger study to determine its impact on delays errors and costs

In monitoring a patient's real-time vital signs through Body Area Networks BAN rich data sources are communicated to medical practitioners. It is essential that data is delivered in a timely and relevant manner. In this paper a system is designed for patients with cardiac disorders with an emphasis on the design of the sensing device and communication scheme chosen. Several existing wearable physiological devices Patient Sensing Device PSD used in the Healthcare systems are bulky in design and are not flexible and comfortable for the elderly patients. Presented is a unique flexible as well as detachable PSD for the comfort of patients. Also discussed is a model for transmission storage and processing of patient related data which ensures periodic logging of patient data without saturating communication networks. A prototype has been created to transmit a patient's ECG signal and body temperature with the ability to add other vital signs in the future. Communication between a mobile smart-phone and the ECG and temperature acquisition apparatus is implemented Bluetooth. The presented Data Management System Periodic Model DMS PM is designed to manage wireless interface of sensor units with the patient database at a Medical Service Provider MSP through a Personal Digital Assistant PDA or a Smart phone making use of the existing GSM network.
Advancement of wireless and mobile technology has enabled additional platforms to support learning in a single learning space. Current trend integrates usage of mobile terminals such as smart PDA in a learning system. Such devices can communicate with wireless mobile terminal and realize the intelligence exchange with its surroundings [1]. A system called One Day Trip is used to help overseas students learn Japanese in real-life situations using a personal digital assistant. This paper proposes the implementation with Knowledge Management concepts in the system to aid the teacher and learners in the learning environment.
In recent years we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking These applications have been written for a special type of digital assistant an alternative to other hardware The Cybiko device was recently discontinued As a result these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful Instead of porting each application to individual platforms which would prove to be extremely time consuming we created the Vassar College Messaging System This layer abstracts the Cybiko networking structure and interface allowing Cybiko applications to be ported to other platforms with minimal code alteration
Unlike many other classes of hardware, smartcards do not have the ability to communicate securely with the user. Deprived of means to keep the owner informed, the positive properties of smartcards are difficult to utilize. We explore the area at the border between smartcards and other, more powerful and thus more useful machines. On the other side of this border we find the Personal Digital Assistant : our view, to be useful as an extension of the user's private sphere, a machine must have enough functionality to create trustworthy digital signatures for the user. A less resourceful machine can merely act as a memory prothesis, helping the owner remembering addresses and phone are : designed to be tamper resistant, and as such they seem ideal as a minimal machine. However, trustworthy digital signatures can not be created by smartcards alone, simply because the user does not know what is given to the card for order to be trusted--that is, being able to make trustworthy digital signatures--a smartcard must be supported by some infrastructure outside the card proper. We explore what must be included in such an infrastructure, and demonstrate that trustworthy digital signatures can in fact be made using a standard argue that based on this fact, nontrivial distributed systems can be constructed by utilizing smartcards; a nontrivial system is one where holders of smartcards are first class citizens. Asserting that a smartcard can act as a trusted machine gives new opportunities for designers of user-centric that smartcards are here to stay, finding ways to apply them in constructive manners is prudent.
In this paper we present the main features of a system that we have developed and that provides a new kind of tele-assistance service to elderly people.apart from the functionalities offered by the current tele-assistance services also provides a high quality anywhere and at any time assistance. We rate the assistance as high quality because it can monitor vital signs and detect any problems in real time sending alerts automatically. AINGERU offers three main functionalities assistance anywhere and at any time monitoring of vital signs and remote monitoring by authorized people. We achieve the functionalities by using a combination of digital assistants wireless communication and web technologies.
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a personal digital assistant (PDA)–based clinical decision support system (CDSS) on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescribing safety in the outpatient setting:\n\nThe design was a randomized, controlled trial conducted in a university-based resident clinic. Internal medicine residents received a PDA-based CDSS suite. For intervention residents, the CDSS included a prediction rule for NSAID-related gastrointestinal risk assessment and treatment recommendations. Unannounced standardized patients (SPs) trained to portray musculoskeletal symptoms presented to study physicians. Safety outcomes were assessed from the prescriptions given to the SPs. Each prescription was reviewed by a committee of clinicians blinded to participant, intervention group assignment, and baseline or follow-up :[108], \n\nPrescriptions were judged as safe or unsafe. The main outcome measure was the differential change in unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs for the intervention versus the control :[135], At baseline, the mean proportion of cases per physician with unsafe prescriptions for the two groups was similar (0.27 vs. 0.29, p ≥ 0.05). After adjusting for initial performance, the group that received the CDSS made fewer mistakes when prescribing NSAIDs compared to the control group. Participants provided with a PDA-based CDSS for NSAID prescribing made fewer unsafe treatment decisions than participants without the CDSS.
Recently pedestrian navigation has been studied by many researchers which provides pedestrians with a similar function of car navigation On the other hand a 3D map is used in city and landscape planning and other engineering fields as a tool for simulation The 3D maps will give more intuitive information compared to conventional 2-dimensional 2D ones In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on 3D maps and describe technologies required and its use situations Secondly we compare effectiveness of 2D and 3D maps for navigation by object search experiments under conditions 3D maps with and without texture display sizes corresponding to a mobile phone and PDA The results showed that 3D maps with features on a phone and 3D maps without features on a PDA were better than 2D maps in searching and accuracy
Mobile agents are a competitive concept of client-server computing and are especially suitable in mobile environments, that are characterized by low bandwidth communication facilities and ad hoc connection/disconnection to stationary systems. They can be used for information retrieval and information filtering. Mobile agents are created on mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, and can perform tasks on other systems over the network. One transmission channel for these itinerant agents is email. This paper introduces Active M 3 as an example of an active mail framework, which can be regarded as a first approach in authoring mobile agents in a graphical interactive manner. Active M 3 integrates two known concepts: active mail and multimedia mail.

Little is known about how new mobile applications emerge in commercial environments. Research in the sociology of technology suggests that the evolution of new applications is a process of social interaction between multiple people. Established technological communities try to impose their own definitions of key problems and solutions on new mobile technology, forcing newer players to redefine a new application area.
In the ubiquitous environment, mobile terminals like personal digital assistant or cellular phone are used to access the Web. We implemented the procedures in a ubiquitous/universal passive viewer (u-PaV) system that transforms Web content into passive viewing content that is especially useful for mobile terminals. Extracting images and text from Web content, u-PaV generates a popular multimedia format. However, mobile and desktop terminals have some differences that affect how content is displayed, such as screen resolution and sound quality. Moreover, when changing the access style between interactive and passive, the presentation should be adjusted for the terminal type because the lacking information is usually not perceived after transformation. To adjust the play style of Web content to the terminal type, we developed a method for visual presentation. We add a color to the background of the screen to show the emotional tone of the web page. We also emphasize the subject of the content by the logotype of the keyword. Third, we segment the picture of the content into pieces and present one after another using visual effects. These procedures can be applied to any type of terminal.
We have developed two-way location aware system, named as “The Beijing Explorer”, which exchanged location information and users' situations in real time using a PDA and GPS. Users can see their position and their chats on the screen of a PDA using the system real-timely. The system was used for the guidance of the Palace Museum (Forbidden City) in Beijing, China. We carried on experiments two times using the system. The results of experiments show that the service using positioning data and sharing contents were valuable and interesting. The correct positioning information is important for the guidance system.
A truly personal machine, called a private machine and implemented as a Personal Digital Assistant is fundamentally different from traditional machines. It is personal and private in an unprecedented manner, and its modus operandi is such that network and power failures will not be rare. Designing systems that treat PDAs as important users is crucial. Users electronic money, passwords, and access keys should be stored in their PDAs and remain under their control. Ownership and control of these assets and the media that store and communicate them should remain with the user. This must be reflected in the design of systems for private introduction of the open-ended argument to describe the design strategy we used for designing a system that is designed to reveal information to the user as opposed to hide it. We argue and show that when systems are designed this way, the user a human is better able to control the system and his personal data, as he can make better decisions than the system itself based on qualitative assessment of the provided information. The system we have designed and implemented under this design is presented and discussed.
Depression is under recognized in a variety of pediatric settings. The purpose of this paper is to develop and evaluate a tool to help nurses screen for depression in children and teens. Three key aspects are: choosing a depression test, integrating the test into the PDA, and evaluating its effectiveness through user testing and feedback. Only one third of eligible patients were screened. Twenty percent of those screened were identified as at risk for mood disorder. The barriers to screening included a lack of time, knowledge, and resources, as well as cultural and technical issues. Ideas for improving education, research, and implementation of PDA-based screening are explored.
This study explored the potential of the application of wireless and mobile computing technologies to be used in improving the efficiency of patient care and education and future developments in information and communication technologies to support healthcare professionals and medical students in healthcare research medical education and training. The study used a systematic review of existing research from various online databases including EMBASE MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. Today more than 50% of healthcare professionals and medical students are using Personal Digital Assistant with expected growth of more than 75% by year-end 2007. In addition wireless and mobile computing technologies allows Personal Digital Assistant to connect directly to networks or the Internet. Studies should evaluate mobile computing technologies to see if they can save time in patient care. Wireless and mobile computing technologies is only beginning to take its first step in improving patient care and education. They have shown a positive impact on patient safety health care efficiency and ultimately patient satisfaction.
Nursing students can learn many things through practical training by experiencing actual medical practice and by coming in contact with patients. Practical training is an effective way for nursing students to learn. Moreover at hospitals which are important training facilities medical safety does not allow electronic learning tools. So we created a learning support environment that facilitates the imagination of nursing techniques and enables effective preparation review and learning at anytime and anywhere using a portable digital assistant PDA device for practical training. This paper describes the digital nursing dictionary we created and its evaluation.

Mobile services and personal data need better protection. Speaker recognition is of interest for its simple and convenient features. In this paper, a robust speaker recognition system which facilitates reliable authentication with multi-channel voices is presented. A large collection of audio recordings from various devices is used to test the system.
This paper presents a method to generate unique and nevertheless highly random pseudonyms in a distributed environment. More precisely, each user can generate a pseudonym on their own device, such as a smart card or digital assistant. There is no need for any information interchange between issuing parties or global data especially keys except unique identifiers for each user and each device of the system. He can prove he generated the pseudonym without revealing his identity and can reveal his identity by sharing the pseudonym. Whereas the verifier of a disclosed pseudonym can be sure that the presenter of the pseudonym is the holder of the pseudonym the person which originally generated it. The user's and device identifiers are used to generate unique pseudonyms and are stored in the pseudonym in encrypted form.
In todayu0027s mobile information society location-based services play an increasingly important role. These services are to be accessed by users with a mobile end device for the use of city maps route planning navigation or traffic information. Mobile end devices however do not have computing power or storage capacity comparable to that of a personal computer or laptop. This paper outlines the experience gained in the development of a prototype for route computation in public transport networks to be used on a personal digital assistant. Breaking down the route calculation into smaller steps helps reduce the work on the mobile device.
DIANE is a digital assistant that helps doctors quickly access hospital information, such as medical records and staff data. The quick access could be achieved by implementing face recognition and live streaming as part of the digital assistant.
Digital assistants are emerging to become more prevalent in our daily lives. In interacting with these assistants, users may perform several tasks in a short time.

Big data, the enhanced ability to collect, store and analyze previously unimaginable quantities of data in tremendous speed and with negligible costs, delivers immense benefits in marketing efficiency, healthcare, environmental protection, national security and more. The principles of data minimization and purpose limitation are struggling to keep up with the rapid changes in big data technological and business reality. As we increasingly interact with these artificial agents in unsupervised settings, with no human mediators, this raises questions about the legal and philosophical implications of their behavior. The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding data driven ethical dilemmas, such as privacy, fairness and discrimination. The machine may exacerbate, enable, or simply draw attention to the ethical challenges, but it is humans who must be held accountable. Policymakers should seek to devise agreed-upon guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling. Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; criteria for calling out unethical, if not illegal, behavior; categories of privacy and non-privacy harms; and strategies for empowering individuals through access to data in intelligible form.
Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups however these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. We conducted a study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including those who are native and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the device. The findings show that compared with their counterparts the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device. It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs. This study can provide valuable insights for designing better voice assistants that work with multiple languages.
the smart speakers cannot distinguish human voice from machine voice \nfigure out whether a human or a machine is sending voice commands to the speaker \nto prevent such machine-voice based attacks to a smart speaker in absence of residents we propose a system consisting of a speaker and a microphone array to detect the existence of a human nearby supposing it can be incorporated in a smart speaker in the future
As smart speakers with voice interaction capability permeate continuously in the world, more and more people will gradually get used to the new interaction medium–voice. Although speech recognition natural language processing have been greatly improved over the past few years, users still may encounter errors from time to time like “cannot understand”, “no requested audio resource (such as music)”, which can frustrate users. Therefore, when an error message is reported, it is vital that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper response. However, currently the response strategies adopted by leading smart speaker brands in China differed mainly on two dimensions: “apology or not”. We looked at how users prefer smart speakers to respond when they make mistakes, such as not understanding what was said or not being able to play music. Two variables were measured: how satisfied users were and how sincere they thought the response was. The results showed that participants were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speakers apologized in both error scenarios. In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no significant impact on the perception of satisfaction and sincerity. But in the “cannot understand” scenario, humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity.
A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process specifically drug molecules compounds in high throughput screening libraries chemical building blocks and nondrug molecules Significant differences were observed between the pharmacophore profiles of drug molecules and those of screening compounds which show a close connection to the profiles of non-drug compounds It is suggested that the analysis of pharmacophore profiles could be used as an additional tool for the property-based optimization of compound selection and library design processes thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects
Annotation of bioassay protocols using semantic web vocabulary is a way to make experiment descriptions machine-readable. Protocols are communicated using concise scientific English, which precludes most kinds of analysis by software algorithms. Given the availability of a sufficiently expressive ontology, some or all of the pertinent information can be captured by asserting a series of facts, expressed as semantic web triples (subject, predicate, object). Assays can be analyzed and compared in different ways, similar to how other parts of the drug discovery process are evaluated. The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) has been previously designed for this express purpose, and provides a layered hierarchy of meaningful terms which can be linked to.
Next generation sequencing produces vast amounts of data, with millions of reads from hundreds of samples. Bioinformatic analysis is typically done with the help of open source tools. This situation leaves bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools, manage the data files and meta-information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.
Special software was used to find patterns between causes of illness and traditional Chinese medicine. The classic Apriori algorithm is useful to mine cases of influenza treated by traditional Chinese medicine.
Identifying antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria in metagenomics samples is essential for public health and food safety. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype and phenotype in humans and other species. a statistical method to estimate the genetic makeup of multiple bacterial types has reduced the false discovery rate and mean absolute error in identifying genetic variations.
