A new mobile app helps with wildfires by giving users easy access to information and tools to coordinate with others. The app is used by firefighters in Greece and is a companion to a larger web-based system called AEGIS. It allows users to find the closest firefighting resources and see important data like weather and water sources. The app can also be controlled by voice commands thanks to a digital assistant named Cortana.
Mobile technology has been applied in education and some mobile devices include personal digital assistants smart phones and e-books. These devices can be used in combination with wireless networks to provide new learning experiences for students. Research has shown that mobile learning is a meaningful way to improve student learning and interaction with the environment. Using mobile devices with suitable learning methods can enhance student learning and is an important issue in education. This study investigated the learning achievement and attitude of elementary school students using mobile devices and competitive learning strategies. The results showed that students who used competitive learning strategies performed better than those who did not. Both groups showed a positive attitude towards learning after the activity.
A wireless patient monitoring system was developed to track a patient's health. It uses a device that can send ECG signals to a local server through Bluetooth. The system includes devices for different users such as doctors and patients. This system allows patients and doctors to be more mobile and flexible which improves the quality of care and the patient's lifestyle.
As people use more devices that show images like high-resolution printers and small display screens on mobile phones the need for high-quality image enlargement has grown. This paper presents a new way to enlarge images while keeping them clear. A major issue with image enlargement is that it makes edges look jagged. To fix this problem we propose a new method that uses a computer algorithm to determine the best values for the new pixels.
Many people have trouble seeing colours. Everyday tasks become hard for them. We created a device to help. It turns everyday scenes into sound for people who can't see. The device takes a picture and breaks it down into different colours. It then sends the colours as sound through headphones. The user can also give feedback to make the device better. This will be possible in the future as technology improves.
A medicine decision support system in a mobile device can help prevent medication mistakes in the elderly. It shows a list of the patient's medicines and warns against bad combinations. We tested this system with nurses who care for patients at home. They found it helpful and easy to use. The system showed them potential problems with the patient's medicines and suggested safer alternatives. The nurses thought it would be a useful tool for their work.
Many large healthcare organizations use systems to manage their appointment schedules but these systems are not easily accessible by clinicians. Staff other than the clinician's assistant may manage scheduling making it hard for clinicians to stay informed of changes. Some clinicians use personal digital assistants to keep track of their schedules but these devices often lack access to the full schedule information.
Partners In Health and its sister organization in Peru, Socios En Salud, treat most patients with a hard to cure disease called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. To track the disease, they collect data from health centers across the city. Instead of sending someone to collect the information by hand, they created a digital system to collect and upload the data. \n\nIn a test, they compared the new system to the old way of doing things. The digital system was faster and made fewer mistakes. Users liked it and it saved time, which means the cost will be paid back in just three months.
To make it easier for doctors and nurses to communicate with each other and share knowledge, a team of researchers created a tool for cardiac patients. This tool was tested at a hospital where nurses work with doctors to diagnose patients with chest pain. The tool helped nurses with and without experience in cardiac care, and it worked well in a team environment.
This paper presents a mobile language learning tool for Korean language learners called M-CALL. To make learning more engaging it includes a fun cyber pet game. The system uses a handheld device and a wireless internet connection to allow learning anywhere. As learners solve language learning problems the cyber pet grows. The tool uses real Korean language tests to set the difficulty level. It includes various features for learning the Korean language. A working version of M-CALL has been created and is being tested on a handheld device and a computer.
People used two types of keyboards with a stylus to type on a handheld computer screen. They typed as fast and accurately as they could into a digital assistant. The QWERTY keyboard allowed them to type faster than the T9 keyboard despite the T9 being easier to use physically. The T9 layout was harder to use because it took longer to look at the letters on the keys. This means the QWERTY keyboard is still the best design for typing on soft keyboards with a stylus.
The rise of smartphones and personal digital assistants opened new ways for mobile shopping. These systems have similar components to standard online shopping apps but also come with unique challenges. For example, mobile devices have limited screens and processing power. This means software development is different from desktop applications. We need to consider what users want to access with their phones and how to provide useful apps with limited input options. Testing these systems is also a challenge. We'll discuss some of these issues based on our experience with a mobile app for booking hotel rooms.
We need to make web content suitable for mobile devices because they have limited capabilities. Since different mobile devices have different capabilities we should adapt content for each one. There are two common ways to adapt content: automated conversion and explicitly specifying the adapted content. However these methods have a trade-off between quality and the effort to develop and maintain them. We propose a simple way to adapt content that avoids this trade-off. We use a model called WebComposition and its XML-based implementation WCML to make this possible. We applied this approach to a real application to show how it can reduce the effort needed to develop and maintain content for different devices.
A device has been designed to monitor patients with heart problems in real time using Body Area Networks. The device is small and comfortable for patients to wear. It can send data about the patient's heart rate and temperature to a doctor's phone. The data is stored and processed in a way that doesn't overload the communication network. A prototype has been made to test this system and it can send ECG signals and body temperature. The device uses Bluetooth to communicate with a phone and a computer system stores the data in a patient database.
Wireless technology has improved learning in many ways. Now people use mobile devices like smartphones to learn in different settings. These devices can connect to the internet and share information with their surroundings. A system called One Day Trip helps students learn a new language in real-life situations using a mobile device. This system uses a concept called Knowledge Management to make learning easier for teachers and students.
We developed apps for wired and wireless networking. These apps were made for the Cybiko personal digital assistant but it was discontinued. We had to move them to other devices. Instead of changing each app for each new device which would be very time-consuming we created a layer that makes it easy to move apps to different devices.
We need a way for smartcards to communicate securely with their owners. Without this, their useful properties are hard to use. We're exploring the boundary between smartcards and more powerful machines. On the other side of this boundary we find the Personal Digital Assistant. To be useful, a machine must be able to create trustworthy digital signatures and have enough functionality and resources. A smartcard alone cannot create trustworthy digital signatures because the user does not know what information is being put onto the card. To make a smartcard trustworthy, it must be supported by some external infrastructure. We're looking into what needs to be included in this infrastructure, and we've found that digital signatures can be made using standard methods. This means we can create nontrivial systems using smartcards, where smartcard holders are treated as equals. If a smartcard can be trusted, it opens up new opportunities for user-centered design.
We present a new tele-assistance system for elderly people that provides high quality assistance anywhere and at any time. It monitors vital signs and detects anomalies in real time and sends alerts automatically. The system offers three main features: assistance anywhere and at any time, monitoring of vital signs, and remote monitoring by authorized people through the internet.
Participants who used a handheld computer program to help them prescribe pain medication made fewer mistakes than those who didn't use the program. The program gave them guidance on how to assess a patient's risk for stomach problems from the medication.
Pedestrian navigation is similar to car navigation and many researchers have studied it. Three-dimensional maps are useful for city and landscape planning and other engineering fields. They provide more information than two-dimensional maps. This paper proposes pedestrian navigation using three-dimensional maps and discusses the required technologies and situations where they can be used. We also compare the effectiveness of two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps in navigation. We did experiments where we searched for objects using maps with and without textures on different devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. The results show that three-dimensional maps with textures on mobile phones and three-dimensional maps without textures on PDAs are better than two-dimensional maps in search time and error rate.
Mobile agents are a way of using computers in mobile environments with slow internet connections. They can be used to find and filter information and return only what's needed. These agents are like small programs that are created on a mobile device and go onto the internet to complete tasks. They can use email as a way to send and receive information. This paper explains Active M3 which is a tool that lets people create mobile agents in a visual way.
DVB-H is a technology that lets phones and PDAs get digital TV signals. This paper looks at how to get digital TV on mobile devices. It explains the DVB-H standard and how it works on a technical level.
A low-cost device was designed using the IDT RV4640 processor to achieve high speed communications. The device can be used for various purposes such as video calls and internet access. The processor is a 64-bit RISC chip that executes instructions quickly. The device also includes a network interface card that allows for fast data transfer and costs under $100.
Dr Who is a Microsoft project that helps people interact with their devices using voice commands. It's a new way to use personal digital assistants like PDAs. Dr Who uses speech recognition and voice commands to let users do things like writing emails or texts without having to type. This makes it easier to use these devices. The device has a built-in microphone and a touch screen that helps the system understand what the user is saying. The system uses a computer to recognize speech and understand what the user wants to do.
Research in the sociology of technology shows how new mobile applications come to be in complex commercial environments is not well understood. The process involves social interaction between groups that try to agree on what mobile technology problems are and how to solve them. This is shown in the early days of the personal digital assistant. Established groups try to tell new players what the main problems and solutions are which forces the new players to completely redefine the new application.
We created a system that helps people access the web on their mobile devices like phones or tablets. This system takes web content and converts it into a format that is easy to view on these devices. We use images and text from the web and turn them into a multimedia format that works well on mobile devices. The way web content looks on mobile devices is similar to how it looks on computers but there are some differences due to the device's screen resolution and sound quality. When people switch from interactive to passive viewing on their devices the presentation also needs to change. We developed a method to adjust the way web content is presented on different devices. We use keywords to represent the emotional tone of a web page by changing the background color and use a special font to highlight the main subject. We also break down images into smaller parts and show them one by one with visual effects. This method works on any type of device.
We developed a system called "The Beijing Explorer" which shares users' locations in real time using a PDA with a GPS receiver and wireless LAN. Users can see their location and chat with others on the PDA screen in real time. We tested the system in Beijing's Palace Museum and found that sharing location data and information was helpful and interesting. Accurate location information is key for the guidance system.
Personal machines like Personal Digital Assistants are different from regular machines because they are personal and private. They are designed to work even when there's a network or power failure. This means that systems should be designed to treat these personal machines as important parts of the system. The goal is to keep the user in control of their personal data and assets like money and passwords.
Depression is often not recognized in kids and teenagers. A new tool was made to help nurses identify depression in children and teenagers aged 8 to 18 using a personal digital assistant. The tool was tested by nurse students and showed some promising results. Only about one-third of children who could be screened were actually screened. About 20% of those who were screened were found to be at risk for a mood disorder. The main reasons for not screening children included lack of time and knowledge about how to do it.
This study looked into how wireless technology can improve patient care and education. Researchers searched through medical databases and observed the use of mobile devices by healthcare professionals and students. Many now use personal digital assistants and this number is expected to grow. Wireless technology can connect these devices to the internet and networks. It has the potential to save time in patient care and improve overall care efficiency and patient satisfaction.
Nursing students can learn many things through hands-on training with real medical practices and patients. Practical training is an effective way for students to develop their nursing skills. However, hospitals can't use electrical devices for learning due to safety concerns. We created a digital tool to help students imagine and practice nursing techniques anywhere, anytime using a portable device. We developed an educational resource called the "digital nursing dictionary" and tested its effectiveness.
Mobile devices have a small screen size and low resolution which makes it hard to view web pages. Web pages are too big for small screens like those on PDAs or low-resolution devices like WebTV. To solve this problem web pages could be broken into smaller parts but this would be very difficult for web designers because they would have to customize each page for many different devices. This paper proposes a system that divides web pages into smaller parts based on the screen size and the type of content. The system also adds summaries and overviews to help users navigate the page and make the most of the screen.
A device was built using a small computer chip called the C8051F005. It monitors voltage and can use an algorithm to analyze the data. The device has two modes and can send the information to a central location using different methods such as a phone line or a special card.
Users can access information online from anywhere with devices like smartphones and tablets. We studied how people switch from using large screens like computers to small screens like personal digital assistants. We looked at three ways to display web pages on small screens: Direct Migration, Linear, and Overview. We found a new method called Gateway that helps users navigate web pages on small screens, based on what they already know. In our study, people preferred using the Gateway and Direct Migration methods for web pages they were already familiar with.
Mobile systems have limitations that need to be considered during software development. We have developed a system to categorize potential risks and applied it to a device that helps with negotiations for a personal digital assistant. We plan to study how to better combine existing risk management techniques with a flexible development method.
Speaker recognition is a biometric technology that is simple cheap and convenient. It's used for authentication and a lot of research is being done on it. This paper presents a system that can recognise voices from multiple channels. A large collection of voices from different devices was used to test the system.
In this paper a method is presented to generate random pseudonyms in a network. Each user can now generate a pseudonym on their personal device without sharing information with others except for a unique code. The user can also prove they created a specific pseudonym without revealing their identity and show their identity by revealing the pseudonym.
In today's mobile society location-based services are very important. People use their mobile devices to access maps, plan routes, get directions, and traffic information. Since mobile devices don't have as much power or storage as computers, special methods were developed to help. This paper shares the experience of creating a route planner for public transport on a personal digital assistant. Breaking the route calculation into smaller steps helps make it work on the mobile device.
DIANE is a digital assistant system that helps doctors quickly access hospital information like medical records and staff data.
Digital assistants are becoming more common in our daily lives. Users interact with them to do multiple tasks at once.
Individuals make decisions based on biases. Our research looks at how managers' biases affect their companies' performance when they make decisions together. We tested different scenarios and found that some biases can actually help a company when combined, but hurt it when used alone.
Big data helps many areas like marketing, healthcare, and national security. However, it also raises concerns about privacy and fairness. As machines make decisions without human oversight, we need to consider the ethics of using and analyzing data. Policymakers should create guidelines for fair data use and protection. This would help prevent misuse of data and give people more control over their information.
We studied how people use a smart speaker called Google Home. We tested it with 20 people who speak English well and 20 people who don't speak English as their first language. The people who speak English well liked the Google Home more than those who don't. Our study shows that how well someone speaks English affects how well they can use a voice assistant. This can help designers make better voice assistants for people who don't speak English well.
We need a way to tell if a smart speaker is receiving voice commands from a human or a machine. To prevent someone from sending fake voice commands to a smart speaker when no one is home we propose a system that includes a speaker and a microphone.
People are getting used to talking to smart speakers but sometimes they still get errors like "cannot understand" or "no audio resource". When this happens it's good for the smart speaker to give a helpful and proper response. We looked at how people like different responses from smart speakers in two situations where they get an error. We found that people were happier and thought the speaker was more sincere when it apologized. When the speaker couldn't find the music someone asked for, using humor did not make a big difference. But when the speaker couldn't understand what was said, using humor actually made people think the speaker was less sincere.
A pharmacophore analysis was used to look at different types of compounds that could be used in drug discovery. The results showed that certain types of compounds were very different from others. This could help us decide which compounds to use in drug discovery and make it more likely to find a successful drug.
Bioassay protocols can be made machine-readable by using special vocabulary. However, the way scientists write these protocols makes them hard for computers to analyze. By using a detailed list of terms, we can express the necessary information in a way that computers can understand. This allows us to search, group and evaluate experiments in various ways. The BioAssay Ontology is a tool that helps with this by providing a list of meaningful terms that can be linked to.
Bioinformaticians face a big challenge when dealing with the huge datasets produced by next generation sequencing Next generation sequencing produces massive datasets and bioinformaticians have to use many different tools to analyze them These tools only do one step at a time so bioinformaticians have to put them together and manage the data and information to get the final result
A computer program called SPSS was used to look for patterns between traditional Chinese medicine and symptoms, syndromes, and causes of illness.
Identifying bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics is important for public health and food safety. New technology called next-generation sequencing can help identify the genetic differences in bacteria. A new method called Genetic Polymorphisms Assignments has improved the accuracy of identifying genetic variations in bacteria.
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for making targeted changes to the genome including editing and regulation. Designing the single guide RNAs needed for these applications is challenging.
Gene editing could be used to solve health care issues and improve the health of future generations. However, this would require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. The role of women in this process has not been discussed and could be morally required. The future generations would be gendered unless an artificial womb is developed. This raises challenging issues that need to be considered by both women and men.
CRISPR-Cas is a tool for gene editing but can cause unwanted effects. Anti-CRISPR proteins can stop this from happening and make gene editing better. We need to study these proteins to learn more about how they work.
CRISPR is a powerful tool that can edit DNA sequences with high accuracy. It helps scientists remove, repair, silence, or activate specific genes by precisely cutting and repairing DNA at targeted locations.
The CRISPR-Cpf1 system is used for genome editing but its efficiency varies with different gRNA sequences. A computer model was made to predict the efficiency of any gRNA. A website called CRISPR-DT now helps users design the best gRNA for the CRISPR-Cpf1 system.
Self-driving cars are vulnerable to attacks due to their communication systems. These systems make them susceptible to various types of malicious attacks. A proposed system uses a special kind of computer algorithm to detect and prevent one of these attacks. The system successfully identifies and blocks malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving cars.
Self-driving cars are becoming more common and will likely play a big role in the future of transportation. However one of the main challenges is getting them to safely share roads with other cars. When two self-driving cars try to drive in the same space at the same time they might crash or get stuck. We studied how self-driving cars can safely merge onto a busy road where cars are going in different directions. We created a system called Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points that lets self-driving cars use their own sensors and communicate with other cars to stay safe. The results of our test showed that our system worked better than other traffic systems and kept traffic moving safely.
This study looks at how stock prices change after companies release certain financial information. We used a data mining technique to sort through over 70,000 filings from U.S. companies to see which ones were most important. We found that some types of news had a bigger impact on stock prices than others. For example, earnings and credit ratings had a big effect on stock prices. Other types of news like business strategies and mergers also had an impact. These findings can help managers, investors, and policymakers make better decisions.
A significant problem when using deep learning techniques is the limited amount of data available for training. There are limited datasets for certain tasks like self-driving cars but very little for industrial robotics. In previous work we trained a special kind of neural network to identify a robot in an image and estimate its joints by using just a 2D picture but it was limited to one type of robot. We extended this method to work with a different robot and instead of collecting a lot of new data we used a technique called transfer learning to adapt the existing network to the new robot. This approach requires much smaller datasets and trains faster reaching similar accuracy to the original method.
We created a computer vision system for self-driving cars that can learn from images of a virtual car's view. This system is based on a pre-existing architecture that is modified to work with images from the front of the car and outputs the best actions for steering, accelerating, and braking.
Humanoid robots have a problem with speech recognition when they move or shake their bodies because of the noise from their motors and mechanical parts. A new system is proposed to help improve this. It uses the information about the motor being on or off to help find the most important sounds. This is done by taking the sounds and the motor information as input for a computer program that identifies sounds. The program learns to identify the most important sounds and then uses those sounds to make a second program that can more accurately identify what the humanoid robot is saying.
Traffic signs can be recognized by intelligent systems which can reduce the number of accidents. Self-driving cars need to automatically recognize traffic and hand-held signs. Various machine learning techniques have been proposed for classifying traffic signs but they do not perform well on multiple benchmarks. Our research proposes a new architecture that performs well on multiple benchmarks. It is made of layers that help the model learn from the data efficiently. This new model scores high accuracy in recognizing German and Belgian traffic signs. We also developed a new technique that uses less memory and computational power.
We developed a way to use a computer model trained on one place to control a self-driving car in another place. The model takes a picture from a front-facing camera and produces a steering command. We added a new part to the model to also predict how far the car is from its lane. We used this model to train a new model that can control a car in a different place. The new model takes the old model's output and decides what steering command to give. We tested this method in two different simulators and it worked better than other methods at keeping the car safe and stable.
A new computer simulation of a stock exchange was created to help researchers and students understand how automated trading systems work. This simulation is called the Bristol Stock Exchange or BSE. Most real stock exchanges now use automated systems instead of human traders and researchers need a way to practice and test these systems. But real stock exchanges are not usually open to testing and researchers have to rely on past data instead. BSE helps to solve this problem by providing a realistic and safe environment for testing and learning. It has been used in a university since 2012 and the code is available for anyone to use.
Passengers in self-driving cars will need to find new ways to entertain themselves once the technology becomes common. Our research shows that our method can predict what entertainment to show in a self-driving car with 98% accuracy and reduce delays. However, getting entertainment from a central server can be slow because of communication delays between the car and the server. To solve this problem we propose a new way to cache entertainment using artificial intelligence on the car's edge computing system. This system predicts what entertainment will be requested based on where the car is and what kind of passengers are in it. The car can then download and cache the right entertainment to show. We turned this system into a problem that can be optimized to minimize delays and solved it using a special algorithm.
Automated decision-making raises questions about responsibility.
Autonomous cars struggle to understand the current driving situation. To improve this, we need to extract meaningful information from images taken by the car's cameras. This involves classifying basic elements of the scene such as streets, buildings, pedestrians, and vehicles. A new method combines images from the car's cameras with pre-existing 3D maps to help identify these elements. This approach was tested in urban environments and showed improved accuracy compared to using images alone.
This paper proposes a benchmark for self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink and ROS. ROS is an open-source framework for robot applications. The automotive industry often uses MATLAB/Simulink for modeling and simulation. We provide a benchmark suite for self-driving systems called Autoware which is open-source software. It offers self-driving modules. The benchmark contains samples from Autoware that help design self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink.
Self-driving systems are becoming more complex as technology advances. To work with these systems the industry typically uses MATLAB/Simulink. However the models made in MATLAB/Simulink are not compatible with self-driving systems that use ROS. To make them work together the code needs to be rewritten and added to the ROS system which makes development time-consuming. A new framework has been proposed that allows models made in MATLAB/Simulink to be used in self-driving systems that use ROS. This makes development more efficient.
Self-driving cars need to be tested for safety but testing them on the road is expensive and risky. A safer way is to test them in computer simulations. We created a tool called AsFault that can automatically generate these tests.
Self-driving cars are becoming more common and people get to experience them in their daily lives. For the self-driving industry to grow, people need easy and natural ways to interact with the car. This paper looks at three ways to do this: eye movement, voice, and hand gestures. It also discusses the good and bad points of these methods and what the future might hold.
Self-driving vehicles have become more common on roads with the promise of improving safety and efficiency. To make them reliable, they need to be tested thoroughly on simulators where they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. It's crucial to test self-driving software in many challenging scenarios. Currently, this is done by humans but we propose a new method to automate this process. We use a technique called Bayesian optimization to create scenarios that can expose weaknesses in self-driving systems and increase the risk of accidents. By adding these scenarios to the training data and fine-tuning the system, we can make self-driving vehicles safer.
People's preferences for self-driving buses in public transport services are not well understood. A study looked at how people feel about taking a self-driving bus compared to a regular bus. The study found that people prefer self-driving buses for short trips because they value their time more. However, they prefer regular buses for longer trips. People who are interested in technology and trust self-driving vehicles like the self-driving buses more.
We are on the brink of a significant transformation in our economy and society due to the digital revolution. While this transformation brings many benefits it also poses great risks. We are moving towards a point where many decisions will be made for us by machines. This is a crossroads and we must choose between a society where decisions are made from the top down and implemented through control or a society where decisions are made freely and together. Modern technology can support either option but the latter has its advantages.
Financial markets are a complex space that banks deal with every day. With modern computers, trades can now be made in a matter of milliseconds.
We present a new way to model and control systems of self-driving vehicles that transport people within cities and balance their numbers to provide good service. We use a mathematical model to design a system that can rebalance vehicles in real time. We tested this system in New York City with a small fleet of self-driving vehicles and found that it could meet current taxi demand with a much smaller fleet. We also studied how the system handles congestion and found that it can reduce traffic problems.
Sensor based robot control is better for tasks like household chores because it can handle uncertain models and unknown environments that other methods struggle with.
Information that is not accurate can be a problem in libraries and online. This can cause issues for people who see a lot of wrong or misleading information. This paper looks at how accurate information is related to information that is not accurate. It also talks about how to tell when information is not accurate. We think that information that is not accurate and information that is intentionally false are related but different. Information that is not accurate is more than just being wrong or incomplete.
Social media is a double-edged sword providing easy communication but also spreading harmful misinformation. We created a system that uses both human and machine intelligence to identify false information. It works by first identifying people's areas of expertise based on what they post online and then matching them with suspected misinformation. Experts are asked to review the information and help prove or disprove it. This paper focuses on finding the right experts to help identify misinformation on social media. We developed a system that assigns expertise based on keywords and tested it on real social media data to show it works.
This paper aims to help researchers study misinformation by creating a model that describes it and makes it easier to share and use. The model can guide future research and help build a digital library of misinformation. We also describe a way to manage misinformation in a digital library.
Online social networks have become popular places for people to share information. Misinformation about emergencies is often spread in these networks and can be true or false. We studied how to identify misinformation in these networks and focused on Twitter. We made a system that looks at user and tweet characteristics to spot suspicious patterns and uses learning techniques to detect false information. Our tests showed that our method is effective at identifying misinformation during emergencies and can do it quickly which can limit how far the misinformation spreads.
The internet changed how we get and look at information. People tend to choose information that fits with what they believe in and ignore the rest. They group together with others who think the same way and make it hard to challenge their views. This happens even when people read news online. Since most people get news from social media a lot of people think that this makes it easier for false information to spread. We studied how people interact with news on Facebook in different European countries like Italy France Spain and Germany. We looked at how often people post like and comment on different pages and how they choose which pages to interact with. We also looked at how people group together around certain pages and create communities that agree with each other.
Italy is the most polarized country followed by France and Germany then Spain. Our results show that trust in news sources can reduce online polarization.
Online social media allow people to see many different opinions. However they also spread false information by letting people choose what they want to see. This creates a problem because people tend to believe what they already think and ignore opposing views. We created a model to understand how this works. In the model most people update their beliefs based on new information but some people reject information that disagrees with what they already think. We found that this simple behavior can cause people to become more divided in their opinions. We also found that even people who don't have a bias can be affected by those who do. Our results show that a little bit of bias can actually help people make more accurate decisions by keeping the information diverse. But too much bias can make people less accurate by limiting the information they see.
If a type of artificial intelligence called superintelligence is built it could be much smarter than humans in all ways. This could be very good or very bad. People are arguing about the possibility of superintelligence and some are spreading false information. This can be very bad because it can lead to bad decisions. This paper looks at ways to stop this from happening and to correct the false information if it does spread. It is hard to correct false information so it is best to prevent it from spreading in the first place.
The spread of false information online can cause big problems and panic among the public and economy. To limit the spread of false information on social media we can launch campaigns to fight it. We analyzed a scenario where many false information campaigns can be launched at the same time. First we created a model to see how false information spreads and we came up with a new idea called cascade priority. We also proved that it's very hard to solve this problem quickly. We looked at real social networks and found a few ways to prioritize the false information. We made new algorithms to solve this problem and our results show they work well.
Some philosophers argue that believing in conspiracy theories is understandable and sometimes even justified. If we look at each conspiracy theory individually, we find that the problems with the evidence are not unique to these theories. Therefore, if there's a problem with how conspiracy theorists use evidence, it's with the principle guiding their use of evidence. We can't assume that conspiracy theories are wrong just because of how they use evidence.
Conspiracy theories have gained a lot of attention recently due to their impact on public events. We studied how conspiracy theories are created and spread on social media during a public health crisis the Zika virus outbreak. Our study showed that people create conspiracy theories when they try to understand a crisis and are unsure of the information they are getting from official sources.
People discuss conspiracy theories online to explain events or express opposition to the government. These discussions are complex and hard to understand. Researchers want to find a way to study and limit the spread of conspiracy theories. This study looks at online discussions on a Reddit community dedicated to conspiracy theories. The researchers analyzed over ten years of conversations to understand what people talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories. They found that people focus on the people behind the theories the actions they take and the targets of these actions. This helps us understand how people think and how to interpret their conversations. The study can also help us understand how conspiracy theories spread and how to stop it.
Blockchain technology was developed for Bitcoin and has become popular with its ability to make transactions secure and easier between people and organizations. We studied what makes people want to use blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. We created a model to understand why people accept or reject these currencies and what factors are most important. Our research provides a better understanding of how people adopt new currencies and can help governments use them in a more effective way.
Cryptojacking is a type of cybercrime where a website secretly uses its visitors' computers to mine for cryptocurrencies. This happens when a website has malicious code that takes advantage of its visitors' computing power without their permission. In this study we looked at how common this is and found that about 1 in 500 websites are doing this.
Smart contracts are programs that run on a blockchain. They are written in a high-level language and then translated to a low-level code. This code is executed on a virtual machine and can be vulnerable to attacks due to poor programming and tools. Smart contracts are valuable and often contain a lot of money so developers and auditors need a way to check for potential problems. We present Vandal a tool that helps check smart contracts for security issues. It converts the code into a logic that users can understand and express security checks in a simple way.
Vandal is fast and robust and works well on most contracts in about 4.15 seconds. It does a better job than other tools.
Bitcoin has become a target for many adversaries due to its popularity.
Decentralised networks need a way for nodes to control how much of a resource they use and prevent attacks from too much traffic. This paper looks at methods used in cryptocurrency projects to control resources in a fair way. We then use these methods to design a fair exchange for certain digital assets.
Cryptocurrency is a rapidly developing financial innovation that has gained popularity worldwide. Its fast changes in value and mixed reactions from governments have caused uncertainty and safety concerns. Our analysis shows that the cryptocurrency market is fragile and prone to big changes.
Cryptocurrency was initially created as a digital currency then various other uses were developed in fields like financial transactions and capital management. This paper helps us understand cryptocurrency by comparing it to traditional financial assets. We found that cryptocurrency is similar to stocks. Our analysis shows that the cryptocurrency market is more fragile than the stock market making it a high-risk investment.
The use of smartphones and smartwatches is very common now and people are using mobile payments more often. Cryptocurrency is also becoming popular with a total value of over 200 billion dollars. It's a good idea to allow cryptocurrency payments on mobile devices. This is especially useful for developing countries where financial services are limited. However the high cost of storage and slow payment processing are major problems. We suggest two ways to make cryptocurrency mobile payments work. One involves a bank and the other does not need a bank. We also found a way for banks to follow rules about knowing their customers and preventing money laundering.
Research has been done on how financial crises spread and how people behave in financial markets. Not much has been studied about how financial news affects the markets. We created a new way to measure how financial news on the internet affects the markets, called the News Cohesiveness Index. We found that it can be used to predict when the markets might be at risk. We looked at news from big news websites every day from October 2011 to July 2013 and saw how the markets and news were connected. We thought that when the news was very similar, the markets would move. Our results showed that when the news was similar, the markets were also volatile.
I propose a way to study how different financial markets move together. I used a method to look at the changes in these markets in four countries: France, Germany, the UK, and the US. I also looked at how a change in the US affects the other markets.
Employers need to be aware of the risks when employees use their smartphones for work. Smartphones can be used for data theft or inappropriate contact that's not traceable through company systems. Detecting corporate fraudsters who are tech-savvy is a constant challenge. These fraudsters use technology to hide their activities and stay off the company network where they can be monitored. This puts a company's sensitive data at risk of theft or sabotage.
Phishers keep changing the code of websites they use in their attacks to look like real websites and avoid being detected. To respond to these changes, a group of algorithms is used to detect phishing websites based on their content. These algorithms can detect over 90% of phishing websites with a low number of false alarms.
Mobile devices are now very common in our daily lives. They have many features like desktop or laptop computers. People can use them for different things. Because they are easy to use, there's a chance they can be used for bad things. The number of mobile phones involved in cyber crimes is increasing. To stop this, we need to analyze these devices with special tools. This paper talks about how to analyze Windows Mobile phones and a way to do it safely. It also describes a tool to analyze these devices and some other devices like PDAs.
Detecting image editing operations is a big problem in image forensics. It helps us understand what has been done to an image and can even expose fake images. We've come up with a new way to detect different types of image editing operations using a deep learning method. This method compares pairs of image patches and decides if they were edited the same way or differently. Our results show that this method is very good at detecting different editing operations.
The use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is becoming more common and this means they will likely be used in digital forensic investigations in the future. These devices often have limited ways to connect to computers such as USB ports or Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Many IoT devices now have built-in encryption to protect user data. This makes it difficult for investigators to access and analyze the data from these devices. This work looks into a way to help investigators by using a technique called electromagnetic side-channel analysis. This technique uses the unintentional electromagnetic signals that devices give off to see what they are doing. It's a non-intrusive way to gather information that doesn't require changing the device. The study of this technique could help investigators and make it possible to solve more cases involving IoT devices.
Detecting changes in a computer's clock is a big challenge in computer forensics. It's hard to catch these changes because the attacker has many ways to hide them. Cloud computers and virtual machines can be easily altered by an attacker. This is especially true for virtual machines which are controlled by their host. To prevent this we need to ensure the timeline on both hosts and guests is accurate or at least detectable. This paper looks at how to keep hosts and guests secure in a cloud and how to detect any clock alterations.
Image tampering is a growing problem because it's easy to do with digital tools. JPEG images are especially vulnerable because they can be tampered with without leaving a trace. Researchers are working on ways to detect this type of tampering. One idea is to use the same way that images are compressed to identify if they have been altered. We propose a new method to detect tampering using this approach. Our results show that it works well in identifying tampered images.
We present a new way to calibrate the movement model of a humanoid robot using just one camera. Our method estimates the robot's body and camera settings. We also developed a way to choose the best positions for the robot that balance the number of observations and accuracy. This approach produces better results than randomly choosing positions. As a result, the robot only needs a few positions to get accurate results. Our method is flexible and can be used with different robots.
We present a navigation system for humanoid robots to move around in cluttered areas by themselves. The system uses a depth camera and creates a map of the environment to help the robot stay on track. It then plans the robot's movements to reach target locations safely. The system also checks for collisions by taking into account the shape of the robot and the obstacles. We tested the system with a humanoid robot and it successfully navigated through difficult areas.
We propose a way for robots to navigate through cluttered indoor spaces more efficiently. By predicting potential obstacles the robot can't see yet the robot can plan a better path and avoid getting stuck. Our method lets the robot navigate through cluttered areas faster than a standard approach.
In many situations users walk on typical paths to specific destinations where a mobile robot is needed. A robot following a person step by step is not always the best solution because there are better paths for the robot. We predict a person's future movements and use this information to help the robot make better decisions about where to go. Sometimes the robot can't see the person because of obstacles or its limited view so our approach helps the robot figure out what to do in these situations.
An autonomous robot often has trouble finding a user to help. This is especially true when the user moves around and the environment gets in the way of the robot's view. We have a new way to figure out how likely it is that the user can be seen from each spot in the environment. Our method uses computer simulations to make this decision. We also take into account how long it will take for the robot to reach different locations and what can be seen from those locations. This way the robot can choose the next place to look that will most likely find the user. Our tests show that our method finds the user faster than a simpler approach.
Robots need to understand their surroundings to move safely in changing environments. Most robots use flat maps to navigate but this is not enough for robots that can climb over objects. We created a system that extracts flat areas from height maps and detects moving obstacles. It then uses this information to plan paths in real time. Our system is fast and can make decisions in under 10 milliseconds.
A lab automation drone is being proposed with a robotic arm attached to it. The arm can pick up small items such as test tubes and micro-arrays. This could make lab work easier. The design of the arm allows it to move in six different directions.
Robot companions have become popular in recent years but can be unstable when walking. To solve this issue some robots have been given wheels to move faster and more stably. These robots can now switch from walking to rolling when needed.
Autonomous vehicles are a major focus of research in the fields of automation and robotics. A drone called MAVNet can fly at speeds of up to 6 meters per second. We compared its performance to other advanced navigation methods. As more drones are used in civilian and commercial activities, there is a growing need for them to be able to navigate on their own. To meet this need, we developed a system that allows a drone to learn how to fly by imitating an experienced pilot. Our system uses a computer model to help the drone detect roads using images from cameras. We trained the system using data collected by flying a drone in urban and semi-urban areas. The data was collected by experienced pilots to ensure safety. Our system was able to navigate roads successfully with an accuracy of 98.44%.
Small drones are useful in civilian applications and are often used in groups or swarms. They are also used for tasks such as surveillance and entertainment. To develop new applications like group displays and entertainment small drones are being networked together.
This study looks at how digital marketing helps small tourism businesses. It finds that using technology-based tools improves a company's abilities. The study shows that four main areas improve when companies use these tools. The main result is that technology helps small tourism businesses not only keep up with online marketing but also lead the way.
The rise of the internet and mobile technology has changed the way we live and work. Many businesses now use digital marketing to promote their brands and products. With so many digital marketing tools available, it can be hard to choose the right ones. This paper proposes a method to help businesses select the best digital marketing tools for their needs. The method makes it easier for businesses to achieve their marketing goals.
Muscle size and strength are often thought to be linked but there's surprisingly little evidence to support this idea. The idea that bigger muscles are stronger is based on weak evidence and there are several reasons to believe they might be separate.
Low-intensity occlusion training promotes muscle growth. Training with low weights and moderate pressure can cause the body to produce more growth hormone than higher intensity training. This type of training is useful for people who can't lift heavy weights due to joint pain or other reasons.
Aerobic exercise has been thought to have little effect on muscle size. However our research and others have shown that it actually increases muscle size both in the short and long term. This changes our understanding of how muscles grow and how we can prevent muscle loss in certain populations.
Stretch training is used in various fitness activities to increase joint movement and prevent injuries. Some studies suggest it can also make muscles bigger. However most of the research has been done on animals and not humans. This review looked at 10 studies to see if stretch training can make muscles bigger in humans. Three of the studies found that stretch training helped. But these studies used equipment to help with the stretching or added weight to make it harder. Two studies that combined stretching with weightlifting found that it made muscles grow. The results suggest that stretching alone doesn't make muscles bigger but adding some resistance or doing it between exercises might help.
Cycle training is a common part of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health. However, its effect on muscle size and strength is not well understood. Professional cyclists have larger muscles than non-athletes. This review discusses how cycle training affects muscle size and strength in the legs and why muscle size increases with cycle training. Cycle training takes longer to increase muscle size compared to resistance training. It seems that cycle training can cause muscle growth in both young and older people but older adults may gain strength more easily. Young adults may need to do higher-intensity cycling to get stronger. Muscle growth from cycle training is due to better protein balance in the muscles.
Resistance training is the best way to build muscle mass and has many health benefits. It's safe and can help prevent many diseases. Research has shown that the amount of exercise you do is the most important thing. The more you do, the better the results.
Current research on resistance training shows that short and long rest intervals can both help build muscle. Some studies suggest that longer rest intervals might be better for building muscle. However further research is needed to confirm this.
Muscle memory exists in the brain and in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle can remember how big it was before and regain that size faster than new muscle. A new model explains how this works. When muscle is first developed it gets extra cell nuclei from satellite cells. These cell nuclei stay in the muscle and help it grow faster when exercised. They can be stable for 15 years or more. This means that early strength training could be a good idea for public health.
Eating small meals often has been thought to help with weight loss and keeping weight off. Some studies have found that eating more frequently is linked to lower body fat. This review looked at many studies that tested how often people ate and how it affected their body composition. The results showed that eating more often was linked to less body fat and more muscle mass. However some extra checks on the data showed that one study might have skewed the results so we can't be sure if eating more often really helps with body composition.
Adults who don't exercise lose muscle mass and gain fat as they age. This can be slowed down with resistance training. Ten weeks of resistance training can increase muscle mass and reduce body fat. It can also improve physical performance and overall health. Resistance training can help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes by reducing fat and improving insulin sensitivity. It can also improve heart health by lowering blood pressure and reducing bad cholesterol.
Compared to eating protein after exercise, drinking alcohol with protein reduces the rate at which muscles repair and rebuild themselves.
Eight healthy men aged 21 on average who had been exercising regularly volunteered for the study.
People did three different exercise sessions with different drinks after each one. The drinks were either a mix of alcohol and carbs, a mix of alcohol and protein, or just protein.
Eight sets of five repetitions at 80% of maximum weight.
Subjects rested for 5 minutes before cycling at a moderate intensity for 30 minutes.
After resting for 2 minutes subjects did 10 short bursts of high intensity cycling at 110% of their personal peak output followed by 30 seconds of lower intensity cycling at 50% of their peak output.
After exercise, the subjects drank a 500 mL solution of either protein or a carb match.
A meal rich in carbohydrates was consumed about 2 hours after exercise to help with muscle recovery.
The 8 hour time frame is a crucial part of recovery after exercise and also the time when blood alcohol levels are high after drinking.
1 hour after exercise a person drank 1.5 grams of alcohol for every kilogram of body weight in 6 equal amounts of vodka mixed with orange juice over 3 hours.
The focus of the early post-exercise period is to fix the body's functions after exercise and help it adapt to fitness changes.
Orange juice was consumed with water instead of alcohol.
Subjects drank the beverages every 30 minutes.
Data from blood, cell signaling and mRNA were analyzed using a statistical method that takes into account two factors.
Exercise after drinking a large amount of alcohol can slow down how quickly the body rebuilds muscle protein.
When drinking alcohol after exercise, athletes see the biggest benefits when they don't consume protein afterwards.
Consuming alcohol after exercise reduces the body's ability to build muscle even when protein is consumed in the optimal amount.
The protein mTORC1 helps integrate signals from food and exercise.
Alcohol hinders the muscle's ability to recover from exercise even when the body has enough nutrients.
The amount of alcohol consumed in this study was based on how much athletes reported drinking during binge drinking episodes.
Some people consume more than others which is a concern for their health and safety.
Eating protein helps muscles recover and carbs help replace energy stores.
Many athletes struggle to find a clear message about drinking and sports performance.
When you drink alcohol after exercise, your muscle recovery is impaired even if you have a good diet.
Our data is of great interest to athletes and coaches.
Our study suggests that moderate drinking may help people recover after exercise and could change the way athletes approach drinking.
Muscle contraction and eating foods high in leucine stimulate the mTOR to help build muscle.
Eating 20-25 grams of protein after exercise and then every 4 hours can help build muscle.
Some athletes in team sports often drink large amounts of alcohol after training and competition.
Binge drinking after exercise can have two main effects on the body one is from the alcohol itself and the other is from the athlete not eating or resting properly because of being intoxicated.
Consuming carbohydrates after drinking can somewhat reduce the negative effects of drinking on the body's ability to rebuild its energy stores after exercise. However the effect of drinking on muscle repair is not well understood.
This study looked at how alcohol affects muscle recovery after intense exercise in athletes.
As people age, their muscles change and lose mass, a condition known as sarcopenia. This can lead to mobility problems. Research has shown that resistance training can help slow down muscle loss and improve mobility in older adults. This review looked at the current research on how resistance training affects mobility in older adults with muscle loss. The results showed that resistance training can improve gait speed, balance, and reduce the risk of falls.
To build muscle, you need to properly plan your workouts including the exercises you do, the order you do them in, how long you rest, how hard you lift, and how many workouts you do. One often overlooked factor that can also affect muscle growth is the length of time you take to do each exercise. This is called repetition duration and depends on how fast or slow you do the exercise. We looked at many studies to see if changing the time it takes to do each exercise can make a difference in muscle growth. The results show that muscle growth is similar whether you do exercises quickly or slowly as long as you are doing 0.5 to 8 seconds per repetition. This means you can choose a wide range of repetition durations to build muscle. However, doing very slow repetitions of more than 10 seconds per repetition is not as effective for building muscle.
After exercise the body takes time to recover and return to a resting state this period is also known as the recovery phase some of the physiological changes that occur during this time are necessary for long-term adaptation to exercise training but some can cause cardiovascular instability during recovery the body's cardiovascular system changes over time during the recovery period and some of these changes can provide insight into when the body is ready for additional training stress this review focuses on the changes that occur in the cardiovascular system after exercise and how they differ between resistance and aerobic exercise we will also discuss how to maximize the benefits of cardiovascular recovery and minimize its vulnerabilities
Exercise can help treat and prevent medical conditions like arthritis and diabetes. It's also good for the heart, reducing risks like high blood pressure and heart problems. People with kidney disease can also benefit from exercise, even those who are on dialysis or have had a transplant. Exercise can help manage kidney disease and improve overall health.
Researchers studied the effect of blood flow restriction on people with knee pain and found that it doesn't improve pain relief or knee function when added to resistance exercise.
In Japan there were 43 million people with high blood pressure in 2010. The government prioritizes managing this condition and recommends lifestyle changes to prevent and treat it. They especially suggest increasing physical activity and exercise. \n\nThis review looked at what types of exercise are best for preventing and treating high blood pressure based on Japanese and foreign articles. It recommends moderate-intensity aerobic exercise like walking or jogging for 30-60 minutes three to four times a week. Resistance exercises can also be helpful but should not be done by people with chest pain.
Physical activity is good for preventing diseases and improving health. Some people think kids should not do strength training, but there is no strong evidence to support this. In fact, many studies have shown that strength training can be safe and beneficial for kids and teenagers, as long as they are properly supervised. It can help improve their motor skills, body composition, and bone health.
There's been a renewed interest in IFast. Research shows it doesn't improve athletic performance in high-intensity, endurance, and resistance exercises.
When you can't exercise as much as you want, you can still maintain your physical performance. This is true for people who exercise regularly and for athletes who are not in their competitive season. They can maintain their endurance for up to 15 weeks by exercising 2 times a week or doing shorter workouts of 13-26 minutes. To maintain strength and muscle size, you can exercise 1 time a week with low intensity.
Consuming certain nutrients around an exercise session can help improve body composition. Some people believe that the timing of these nutrients is more important than the total amount of nutrients consumed. After a workout, the body needs nutrients to repair muscle tissue and restore energy. Consuming the right mix of nutrients after a workout can help the body recover faster and perform better. Researchers have talked about a "window of opportunity" after exercise where the body can adapt and build muscle. However, the importance of this window is still debated and can depend on several factors.
To make exercise more efficient, researchers looked at how to do strength training quickly. They found that focusing on exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once is best. These exercises include squats, pull-ups, and bench press. The most important thing is the number of times you exercise each muscle group per week, not how often you train. At least 4 sets of each muscle group per week is recommended.
Resistance training frequency doesn't significantly impact muscle growth if the volume of exercise is the same. When the volume is not equal, higher frequencies may have a slight advantage but the difference is not very big.
Specialized training techniques can increase muscle growth. Techniques like forced repetitions and supersets are thought to help muscles grow more. This article will look at how these techniques can be used in workout programs.
The quest to increase muscle mass is a common goal for those who exercise. It's not clear what type of exercise routine is best for building muscle. Bodybuilders often train with lighter weights and short breaks between sets, while powerlifters use heavier weights and longer breaks. Both groups can achieve impressive results, but it's unclear which method is more effective for building muscle.
