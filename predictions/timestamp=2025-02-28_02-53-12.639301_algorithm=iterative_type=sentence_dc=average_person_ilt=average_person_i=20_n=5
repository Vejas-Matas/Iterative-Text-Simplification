In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are being researched by both academics and industries.
Drones used in both personal and business settings, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a computer-based learning method to driving by learning to fly by copying a skilled pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been built using a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
