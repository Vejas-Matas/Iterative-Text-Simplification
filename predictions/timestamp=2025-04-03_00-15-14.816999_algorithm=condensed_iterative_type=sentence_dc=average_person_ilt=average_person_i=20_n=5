In the modern era of automation, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for learning to fly in a city by copying a skilled pilot.
Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of an Inception model that uses input images.
