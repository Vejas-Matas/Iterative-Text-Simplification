The ingestion of 20-25 grams of protein every 2 hours after exercise has been shown to maximise the muscle growth response.
However, a second finding was that even when protein is consumed, it is only partially effective at stimulating muscle growth compared to when it is consumed alone. The intake of alcohol reduced MPS by ∼24%, representing only a partial ‘rescue’ of the anabolic response compared with protein alone.
Phishers continue to alter the source code of the web pages used in their attacks to mimic changes to legitimate websites of spoofed organizations and to avoid detection by phishing countermeasures. Manipulations can be as subtle as source code changes or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. To appropriately respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, a cadre of file matching algorithms is implemented to detect phishing websites based on their content, employing a large dataset of 17,992 phishing attacks targeting 159 brands. The results of the experiments using various content-based methods demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
It is thought that eating small meals often can help with weight loss. Several observational studies lend support to this idea. This review examines the relationship between eating frequency and body fat. Eating more often can help you lose fat. These findings should be carefully considered.
They drank the drinks every 30 minutes.
The focus of the after exercise period is to enhance processes that help the body recover from and adapt to exercise [1].
Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. We conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including native English and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker. Native English speakers had a more positive experience using the device compared to non-native English speakers. It also shows that users' language skills are crucial for interacting with these devices. This study provides insights for improving voice recognition and language support.
In recent years, we have developed applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking. These applications have been written for the Cybiko personal digital assistant, an inexpensive alternative to other hardware. Unfortunately, the Cybiko PDA was recently discontinued. As a result, these applications had to be ported to other platforms to remain useful. Instead of porting each application to individual platforms, which would prove to be extremely time consuming because of other API's and networking protocols, we created the Messaging Layer. This layer simplifies the Cybiko networking code, making it easy to transfer the applications to other platforms with minimal code alteration.
Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres. A new cell biological model explains how muscle cells remember their previous growth. Previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and myonuclei remain stable in the body for at least 15 years. If this memory exists in humans, early strength training might be a good public health advice.
Moral responsibility is a major concern in automated decision-making, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to kidney exchanges.
Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most robots, humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions. For humanoids, a 2D map is not enough because they can step over objects because they need height information. We tested our framework in simulations and real-world experiments and found that it can plan 3D footstep paths in under 10 milliseconds.
As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy. In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features. The robot's motor status helps improve speech recognition. The second model combines the most important sound information with the robot's sound features. When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process (specifically, drug molecules, compounds in high throughput screening libraries, combinatorial chemistry building blocks and nondrug molecules). The profiles for drug molecules and high-throughput screening compounds are similar to those of nondrug molecules. Pharmacophore analysis can be used to optimize compound selection, thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects.
The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation. Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it might improve the health of individuals and communities, and, if successful, might be seen as a public good. However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. Women may be expected to carry edited embryos. Future generations will be gendered, but only if an artificial womb is not developed. Experts disagree on gene editing, so we need to rethink the role of women in this process.
Limitation in display size and resolution on mobile devices is one of the main obstacles for wide-spread use of web applications in a wireless environment. Web pages are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV. Manual reconstruction of web pages for these devices would ease the problem; however, the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have to customize a web page for each possible display device. In this paper, we propose a document segmentation system. The system automatically divides a web document into a number of segments based on the screen size and the document content. Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also extracted to facilitate navigation. The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding.
This paper presents M-CALL, a mobile computer-assisted language learning courseware for Korean language learners. Since conventional computer-assisted language learning is often boring, it exploits a cyber pet game to increase the learner’s interest. M-CALL runs on a personal digital assistant with public wireless LAN for mobile learning. It grows a virtual pet as you learn Korean. Korean Proficiency Test (KPT), a nationally certified Korean language test, was used as problem sets. It consists of cyber pet game, mobile learning courseware, mobile learning system, and mobile tutoring. It provides various functions for Korean language learning. Currently, the prototype M-CALL was designed and partly implemented between mobile PDA and personal computer.
In this paper, a lab automation drone notional concept is introduced. Here, a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft. The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to manipulate small laboratory objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes. The resulting drone could augment existing laboratory operations. The 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm and gripper design are presented. Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given.
Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems. These communication systems make self-driving vehicles vulnerable to various types of cyber attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS) and other malicious threats. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The system uses a neural network to detect a common type of attack in VANETs, known as Denial-of-Service (DoS). The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.
