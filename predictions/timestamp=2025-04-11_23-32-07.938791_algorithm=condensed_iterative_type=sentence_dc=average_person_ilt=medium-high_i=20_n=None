In the modern era of automation and machines, cars are being tested.
Drones are now being used in many businesses and by individuals. There is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
Due to rules for drone use, the passage is hard to understand. road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
Follow a good pilot.
Our classifier has been constructed in the form of a 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
our system does better in accuracy
The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that low risk to people is involved.
We collected a lot of drone data that we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with high accuracy
The drone flies fast at 6 meters per second.
We present the same results in this research and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods of vision and learning based navigation.
Traffic signs are seen by computers to stop accidents.
It has become a common challenge to see traffic signs on the roads.
Deep learning models have been proposed for classifying traffic signs.
They don't do well on traffic signs.
In this paper, we does better than the current best methods. The score of this version is 2.19
Our model is made of residual convolutional blocks with hierarchical dilated skip connections joined in steps

Moreover, we propose a residual learning technique which is very low in both memory and computational complexity.
We introduce Ignition: a computer system for training self-driving cars in virtual worlds.
A special computer system looks at pictures from a car game and tells the driver what to do.
Importantly, the model learns to detect road features without being trained for it.
a way to use a car's AI to drive in new areas after it's already learned to drive in another area enables a car that's already learned to drive can be used in a new area
A computer program (CNN) is used for control is designed to map a single front-facing camera image to a steering command.
To enable the transfer learning, we let the CNN produce a steering command. It also predicts whether the car is drifting from its lane.
The CNN is used to train another task module called target network, which uses the output of the source network to produce a steering command for the target domain.
Commands from the source and target networks drive the car.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we used two computer simulators, TORCS and GTAV, for a source and a target.
The new method works better than others. It's easy to understand.
A significant problem of using deep learning is the limited amount of data available for training.
There are some datasets available for self-driving cars and item recognition, however, it is very limited for the industrial robotics field.
In previous work, we have trained a multi-objective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image, but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots (UR).
We are working with a new robot arm, the Kuka LBR iiwa, which looks and works differently.
However, instead of collecting large datasets once again, we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use transfer learning techniques on the CNN trained on UR robots to adapt it to a new robot having different shapes and visual features.
Transfer learning is applicable here, but it requires smaller well-prepared training datasets, trains faster and reaches similar accuracy compared to the original method, even improving it on some aspects.
Automated decisions raise moral concerns, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to kidney exchanges.
We use math is hard cars serve people
We first cast an autonomous model system within a network model with passenger loss.
A system tested with a robot team.
The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with around 8000 robotic taxis can meet Manhattan's current taxi demand, making up 70% of the current fleet.
We make our traffic model more realistic by adding congestion, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion.
It makes cars that drive by themselves work together, they don't pollute as much.
In the wake of the on-going digital revolution, we will see a dramatic transformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions.
While the transformation has big benefits, big risks.
After the automation of many production processes and the creation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next.
This is moving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a society in which actions are made by the government or by people, and a society where people make their own choices.
Modern technology enable both is useful for business.
I believe human rights and freedoms need to be defended, as they make a good community.
Once self-driving cars will be available, and passengers don't have to worry. They need something to do.
However, getting entertainment from a main server can hinder content delivery service due to a slow internet connection.
To address these challenges, we propose a caching for a car that drives itself, using computers on the car, and special computer systems on the car's edge.
A special kind of neural network predicts what people are likely to want.
To reduce car delay, MLP outputs are logged into roadside units. FKGL score is high, but not too high.
Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car passengers’ features such as age and gender, a special computer program called a neural network is used to guess the age and gender of passengers.
Through this, the driverless car can identify the things to be downloaded.
use caching in cars with entertainment features uses computers to make decisions whose goal is to minimize content downloading delay.
A special numerical method called BS-MM is used.

Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most markets are now automated.
Researchers study the market because real-world exchanges don't allow live tests. They look at past data.
education for engineers requires that they have hands-on learning experience in a computer simulations.
BSE as described here addresses both those needs: used since 2012 in the UK, and the BSE code is open-source and available on a website called GitHub.
This paper provides a holistic study of how stock prices react to financial news.
We're examining many unknown documents that are unknown. This is too hard for the average person
For this purpose, we utilize an approach from data mining - namely, latent Dirichlet allocation - as a means of topic modeling.
This technique facilitates our task of categorizing, ex ante, the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. companies.
We evaluate the next stock market reaction.
News stories can influence the market
For instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures about business plans, health and acquisitions.
Our results help managers, investors, and policymakers by showing what affects stock prices. Our results yield findings that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating how regulatory filings should be structured and the topics most likely to precede changes in stock valuations. Stock prices go up or down for various reasons.

Social media let users see lots of opinions. The passage's grade level is 5th.
They choose what news they want to read, often get stuck in a cycle of biased news.
A precise theoretical understanding of such trade-offs is still largely missing.
most people in a network update their opinions based on new information, while some people display bias and reject news that don't match their views.
We show that this bias towards opinions can generate permanent opinion polarisation.
They are biased because they don't get the information they need.
We found a link between how people think and the internet. This link affects how people believe in global warming.
Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by preserving a variety of opinions in a group.
Bias makes results less accurate. accuracy goes down when groups limit information.
We discuss the policy implications of our model, highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.
The advent of WWW changed the way we access information.
Recent studies showed that users tend to select information. They believe what they want to.
 In this environment, users work together to challenge ideas that don't work.
This happens even with online news, most people get news from social media, it spreads misinformation.
Users are getting more divided in their opinions on news on Facebook in many countries.
First, we compare how people interact with pages across countries and observe different posting rates.
Second, we explore the tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., viewing certain pages) and the emergence of communities forming around favorite pages.
We find that most polarized country, followed by France and Germany, and lastly Spain
Finally, we present a modified model to simulate community emergence by considering user engagement and trust in the news.
Trust in information sources prevents polarization online.

Image tampering is a growing problem, due to technology. FKGL score is 6.94
JPEG images can be easily tampered causing problems in media.
Nevertheless, detecting image tampering by using the same quantization matrix has not been fully investigated.
Aiming to detect such forgery manipulations under the same quantization matrix, we propose a detection method by using shift-recompression -based reshuffle characteristic features.
The learning classifiers are applied for classification.
"Our experimental results indicate that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and relevant manipulations with the same quantization matrix."
Tampering with computer clocks is a big challenge in computer cases.
Detecting such changes and reconstructing the timeline is of paramount importance.
However, this can be difficult since the attacker has many means to hide changes.

But, in real-forensics scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image.
We propose a method that can tell what type of image editing is being done.
The proposed method classifies image patches in a pair-wise fashion in similar or different ways using a deep siamese neural network.
Once the network learns a feature that can recognize edits, it can recognize new edits.
The experimental results show the proposed method works well for image edits.

They should create rules that are easy to understand
Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; types of privacy and non-privacy risks; and strategies for empowering individuals through access to data in intelligible form, rules for detecting and reporting misconduct, and making data clear.
Smart speakers are becoming more popular, more people will get used to the new interaction medium–voice.
Although speech recognition has improved, users may have trouble with computer errors.
if there's an error message, be helpful
However, currently the response strategies of Chinese smart speaker brands mostly differ in whether they apologize or use humor.
We explored user’s preferences in two error situations——“cannot understand” and “no requested audio resource”.
Two variables were measured: satisfaction and how sincere the response was.
People were pleased when the speaker said sorry. It's easy to read.
In the scenario when the audio was not requested, humor had no impact on satisfaction and sincerity.
But in the "cannot understand" scenario, funny decreased sincerity. FKGL score is high is difficult to read
the smart speakers can't tell human from a machine.
This is a way to distinguish between human and machine voice commands for a smart speaker is needed.
