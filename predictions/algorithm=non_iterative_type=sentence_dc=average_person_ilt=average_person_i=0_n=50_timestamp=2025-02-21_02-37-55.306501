Autonomous vehicles are a focus of research today.
As drones become more common in civilian and commercial use there's a growing need for them to operate on their own.
Civil drones are being navigated using road-tracking due to government regulations.
We propose a solution to help drones navigate city streets by learning to fly like an expert pilot.
Our classifier is based on a 39-layered model that looks at pictures to see if they show roads.
Our system performs better than many existing models for imitation learning.
The data was captured by experienced drone pilots while flying in urban and semi-urban areas.
Permissions were taken from the authorities to ensure minimal risk to pedestrians.
We successfully navigated through roads without crashing or overshooting with an accuracy of 98.44%.
The drone can fly at speeds of up to 6 meters per second.
We present the same results in this research and compare them with other methods.
Traffic signs can help reduce accidents.
Recognizing traffic and hand-held signs is a big challenge with self-driving cars.
Machine learning techniques are used to classify traffic signs.
They perform well on one data-set but struggle with others.
We propose a new architecture that performs well on many tasks and better than current best approaches.
Our model is made of blocks with skip connections that help the information flow.
We scored 99% accuracy in a German sign recognition test and 99% accuracy in a Belgian traffic sign test.
We propose a new learning technique that uses less memory and computation.
We introduce a new system for training self-driving cars in a virtual environment.
A car racing model is fed images of a car's front and tells the driver how to steer, accelerate and brake.
The model doesn't learn to recognize specific road features like track outlines or distances to other cars but can still figure out these details.
We present a new method for teaching a computer to control self-driving cars using a type of neural network.
A CNN is used for steering control that takes a single camera image.
We added a new task to the CNN to predict a lane departure level.
A source network is trained on a specific task. Then another network is trained to perform a different task using the source network's output.
The commands from the source and target network are combined and used to control a car.
We used two simulators to test the method. One was for the original environment and the other for the new environment.
The proposed method outperforms other methods in controlling cars safely and stably.
Limited data is a major issue with deep learning.
There are limited datasets available for industrial robotics.
We previously trained a computer model to identify the robot in an image and estimate its moving parts but it only worked with a specific type of robot.
We extended our method to work with a new robot arm.
Instead of collecting large datasets we collect smaller ones with a few hundred frames each and adapt a pre-trained model to a new robot with different shapes and features.
Transfer learning is faster and more efficient than the original method.
Moral responsibility is a concern in automated decision-making.
We present methods for modeling and controlling systems where self-driving vehicles transport people in cities and move to areas of high demand.
We cast a self-driving system in a closed network.
A robust rebalancing algorithm is used in a study of New York City and tested on an eight-vehicle robot.
In New York, 8,000 robotic taxis could meet the current taxi demand in Manhattan.
We study how vehicles rebalancing affects traffic congestion.
This paper provides a way to coordinate many self-driving cars and shows the benefits of using them.
Our economy and many of our societal institutions will change dramatically.
There are also tremendous risks to our society.
Automation is the next step in many areas of life after production and transportation.
We're at a crossroads where we can choose between a society where decisions are made by a few and enforced or one where people make their own decisions freely.
Modern technology enables both communication and information systems but the latter has economic and strategic benefits.
Human dignity and democracy are important principles of a livable society.
When self-driving cars become common, people will need to find new things to do while riding.
Retrieving entertainment content from a central location can slow down its delivery.
