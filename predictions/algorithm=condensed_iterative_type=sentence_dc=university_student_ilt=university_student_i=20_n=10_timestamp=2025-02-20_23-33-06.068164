The identified section's complexity is still above the desired complexity (University student). The next step is to propose a simplification of the next section. \n\nThe new section is: "autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research"\n\nThis section is still above the desired complexity for a university student, so I will propose a simplification. \n\nThe proposed simplification is: "autonomous vehicles are the focus of academic and industrial research"\n\nThis simplification removes the phrase "currently", which is a time indicator, but still conveys the main idea that autonomous vehicles are the focus of research.\n\nHowever, I need to check the information loss and its severity. The original passage contained the information that the focus is "currently" on autonomous vehicles, implying that it may change in the future. The proposed simplification still conveys the main idea, but loses some nuance. The information loss is low to medium, and the severity is below the information loss tolerance (Medium), so I will update the current state of the passage.\n\nThe updated passage:\nIn the modern era, autonomous vehicles are the focus of academic and industrial research.
The identified complexity is already at the desired complexity level (University student), so the answer is: No
However, since the algorithm is designed to simplify the text if it is above the desired complexity, let's analyze the passage again.\n\nThe identified complex part is: "regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones"\n\nThe complexity of this part is related to the vocabulary used, specifically the phrase "operation ceiling." This term is a bit technical and might be unfamiliar to a university student.\n\nThe determined complexity is indeed above the DC (University student).
Is the determined complexity of the revised passage higher than DC (University student)?
The identified section is "39-layered Inception model". The complexity of this section is approximately 9 (using the Flesch-Kincaid readability test). This is higher than the desired complexity for a university student (around 5-7).

is below the information loss tolerance (ILT) of Medium. Therefore, we can proceed with the simplification.\n\nThe passage with the simplified section is: "The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts with extensive flying experience."
The complexity of the passage is at the desired level for a university student (DC), so the algorithm terminates here.

Since the passage is short, we can consider it as a single unit. The complexity of the passage is 2 or 3, which is lower than the DC of a university student (6-7). Therefore, the answer is: No
