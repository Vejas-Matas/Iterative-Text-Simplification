Superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. He found that certain materials, like mercury, can conduct electricity with zero resistance when cooled to a certain temperature. Further research revealed that electrons in these materials pair up, allowing them to move freely without resistance. The phenomenon of superconductivity was first observed in mercury and was later found in other materials. However, the study of superconductivity is complex and still an active area of research.
