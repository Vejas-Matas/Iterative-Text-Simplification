                  <div class="text-muted">Perception of the environment is <strong> necessary</strong> for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most <strong> robots (humanoids</strong> and wheeled <strong> robots)</strong> rely on planar regions. For <strong> humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics),</strong> a 2D map is not sufficient <strong> because</strong> they can step over and onto <strong> objects, so they</strong> need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> bring</strong> another level of complexity, <strong> because it</strong> can lead to necessary replanning or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low <strong> processor</strong> cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps <strong> for</strong> better weight maintenance. Several studies support this hypothesis, with <strong> a link</strong> between the frequency of eating and <strong> being overweight. This</strong> review <strong> aims</strong> to present and discuss a research on meal frequency with respect to changes in <strong> body</strong> mass. <strong> Eating</strong> frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and <strong> increasing</strong> in fat-free mass. However, the positive findings were the product of a single study, <strong> leaving a</strong> doubt <strong> about the beneficial effect of</strong> frequent meals on body composition. In conclusion, although the initial results suggest a potential benefit of increased <strong> eating</strong> frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be <strong>carefully interpreted.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Small screens</strong> and <strong> low resolutions</strong> on mobile devices <strong> are a major obstacle for</strong> the <strong> widespread adoption</strong> of web applications in a wireless environment. <strong> PDA screens</strong> are often too <strong> small</strong> to <strong> display entire web pages. Low-resolution devices like WebTV face the</strong> same <strong> problem. Manually reconstructing</strong> web pages for these devices would <strong> help, but</strong> the <strong> wide range</strong> of display capabilities <strong> would make it challenging for</strong> web page designers <strong> as</strong> they <strong> would</strong> have to customize <strong> each</strong> web page for <strong> every</strong> possible display <strong> device, increasing their workload. This paper suggests</strong> a <strong> system for segmenting</strong> and <strong> presenting documents.</strong> The system divides a web document into logical segments <strong> automatically, using information about</strong> the screen <strong> size, document structure,</strong> and <strong> content. The system also extracts summaries</strong> and overviews to <strong> make navigation easier.</strong> The system <strong> optimizes</strong> the use of the screen for information <strong>finding by showing the segments and structure of a web document.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">In recent years, we have <strong> created</strong> applications for teaching both wired and wireless networking. These applications <strong> are designed</strong> for the Cybiko personal digital assistant, <strong> which offers a cost-effective</strong> alternative to other <strong> hardware options. The</strong> Cybiko PDA was <strong> discontinued recently. Consequently,</strong> these applications <strong> needed</strong> to be <strong> adapted</strong> to other platforms to <strong> maintain their usefulness. To avoid the time-consuming task</strong> of porting each application to <strong> various platforms due</strong> to <strong> different APIs</strong> and networking protocols, we <strong> developed</strong> the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer <strong> simplifies</strong> the Cybiko networking structure and interface, <strong> making it easier to adapt</strong> Cybiko applications to <strong> different platforms without needing</strong> to <strong>make significant changes to the code.</strong></div>

This paper presents</strong> a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid <strong> robots. On/off</strong> state of the motor is <strong> used to find</strong> relevant input features. <strong> Bottleneck features</strong> have been successfully applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR) <strong> systems based on deep neural networks (DNN). The</strong> motor on/off state data <strong> and</strong> acoustic features <strong> are used</strong> as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling. <strong> The</strong> second DNN for primary acoustic modeling <strong> uses</strong> both bottleneck features from the first DNN and <strong> acoustic ones. The</strong> proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, experimental results show that improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems. <strong></strong></div>

Web</strong> pages <strong> are often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with</strong> low <strong> resolution such as WebTV. Manual reconstruction of web pages for these devices</strong> would <strong> ease the problem; however, the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they</strong> have to <strong> customize a web</strong> page for <strong> each possible display device. In this paper, we</strong> propose a <strong> document segmentation and presentation system. The</strong> system <strong> automatically divides</strong> a web <strong> document</strong> into <strong> a number of logical segments</strong> based on <strong> the</strong> screen size and the <strong> structure and content of the document. Additional information such as</strong> overviews and summaries <strong> is also extracted</strong> to <strong>facilitate navigation. The system presents the segments and structural information of a web document to make full use of the screen for information finding.</strong></div>

Designers</strong> would have to <strong> make separate versions of each</strong> page for <strong> different devices which is a big problem. We</strong> propose a system <strong> that breaks down</strong> a web <strong> page</strong> into <strong> smaller parts</strong> based on screen size and the <strong> page&amp;#x27;s structure. It also includes</strong> overviews and summaries to <strong>help users navigate.</strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Small screens</strong> and <strong> low resolutions</strong> on mobile devices <strong> are a major obstacle for</strong> the <strong> widespread adoption</strong> of web applications in a wireless environment. <strong> PDA screens</strong> are often too <strong> small</strong> to <strong> display entire web pages.
