We explore the area at the border between smartcards and other, more powerful (and thus more useful), machines. On the other side of this border we find the Personal Digital Assistant :[66],&quot;our view, to be useful as an extension of the usersu0027 private sphere, a machine must at least have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures (to speak for the user, as it were).

However, trustworthy digital signatures can not be created by smartcards alone, simply because the user does not know what is given to the card for :[163],&quot;order to be trusted--that is, being able to make trustworthy digital signatures--a smartcard must be supported by some infrastructure outside the card proper. We explore what must be included in such an infrastructure, and demonstrate that trustworthy digital signatures can in fact be made using a standard :[211],&quot;argue that based on this fact, nontrivial distributed systems can be constructed by utilizing smartcards; a nontrivial system is one where holders of smartcards are &quot;first class citizens&quot;.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

It incorporates a built-in microphone that activates whenever a field is selected. As a user taps the screen or uses a built in roller to navigate, the tapping action narrows the number of possible instructions for spoken word understanding. MiPad currently runs on a Windows CE Pocket PC with a Windows 2000 machine where speech recognition is performed. The Dr Who CSR engine uses a unified CFG and n-gram language model.

The paper discusses MiPadu0027s design, implementation work in progress, and preliminary user study in comparison to the existing pen-based PDA interface. MiPad is the application prototype that demonstrates compelling user advantages for wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, MiPad fully integrates continuous speech recognition (CSR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) to enable users to accomplish many common tasks using a multimodal interface and wireless technologies. It tries to solve the problem of pecking with tiny styluses or typing on minuscule keyboards in todayu0027s PDAs. Unlike a cellular phone, MiPad avoids speech-only interaction. It incorporates a built-in microphone that activates whenever a field is selected. As a user taps the screen or uses a built in roller to navigate, the tapping action narrows the number of possible instructions for spoken word understanding. MiPad currently runs on a Windows CE Pocket PC with a Windows 2000 machine where speech recognition is performed. The Dr Who CSR engine uses a unified CFG and n-gram language model.

Moreover, hospitals, which are important training facilities, <strong> do not allow</strong> the use of learning tools that produce electrical waves <strong> due to medical safety concerns.

In the simulations, <strong> managers</strong> decisions which are based on organizational <strong> skills</strong> and <strong> rules,</strong> suffer from <strong> several</strong> known <strong> biases.</strong> The results illustrate how <strong> combined</strong> biases in different contexts affect organizational performance. <strong> Contrary</strong> to <strong> expectations,</strong> some combinations of biases improve organizational <strong> performance.

Misinformation is</strong> any false or inaccurate information that is spread intentionally or <strong> not.</strong> In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in <strong> social media,</strong> and we focus in particular on <strong> Twitter. We</strong> build a misinformation detection model that identifies suspicious behavioral patterns and detect misinformation. <strong> We found</strong> 80294 unique tweets and 59660 <strong> users.

                  <div class="text-muted">Motivated by recent financial <strong> crises,</strong> research efforts have been put into studying contagion effects <strong> (spread of market disturbances)</strong> and herding behaviour <strong> (individuals acting collectively without centralized direction)</strong> in financial markets. Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets. We propose a measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic risk <strong> indicator, which signals probability of financial system crises.</strong> We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from Web news sources and analyse the <strong> relation</strong> between financial markets and <strong> financial</strong> news. We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects <strong> variations</strong> in the financial markets. Cohesiveness is <strong> a better</strong> measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms. Our results <strong> show</strong> that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly correlated with <strong> variations in</strong> the financial markets. <strong></strong></div>

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

In the <strong> first version,</strong> the user <strong> could give</strong> feedback to <strong> change</strong> the system, <strong> but we couldn't add all the</strong> features <strong> due to</strong> technology <strong> limitations.

We conducted</strong> a randomized, controlled trial in a university-based resident clinic. <strong> Residents in internal</strong> medicine <strong> were given a CDSS suite based on PDA. Intervention</strong> residents <strong> were provided with</strong> a CDSS <strong> that had</strong> a prediction rule for <strong> assessing</strong> gastrointestinal risk <strong> related to NSAIDs</strong> and <strong> recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as</strong> standardized patients <strong> (SPs), who were equipped with</strong> musculoskeletal <strong> symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the</strong> study <strong> without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety</strong> outcomes <strong> of</strong> prescriptions given to <strong> standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A</strong> committee of clinicians <strong> who didn't know about the</strong> participant, intervention group assignment, <strong> or the</strong> baseline or follow-up <strong> data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was</strong> safe or unsafe. <strong> The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The</strong> main outcome <strong> measured</strong> the <strong> difference</strong> in unsafe prescribing <strong> between</strong> the intervention <strong> and</strong> control <strong> groups. At</strong> the <strong> beginning</strong> of the <strong> study, both</strong> groups <strong> had a</strong> similar <strong> proportion of unsafe prescriptions.</strong> (0.27 <strong> vs 0.29) After controlling</strong> for <strong> the</strong> baseline performance, <strong> it was found that those who received the CDSS suite</strong> prescribed <strong> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> more safely than <strong> those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to</strong> the CDSS <strong> through a PDA</strong> documented <strong> a</strong> more <strong> comprehensive</strong> assessment of gastrointestinal risk <strong> in patients. Moreover, the presence of the</strong> CDSS <strong> resulted in</strong> fewer unsafe treatment decisions <strong> compared to</strong> participants <strong> who did not have access to</strong> the CDSS. <strong></strong></div>

We particularly study</strong> the <strong> many uncategorized filings. We use</strong> latent Dirichlet allocation <strong> for</strong> topic modeling. This <strong> helps</strong> automatically <strong> predict</strong> the <strong> categories based on the</strong> content of 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. <strong> companies, which announce significant events relevant to shareholders.</strong> We then evaluate the stock market reaction. <strong> Evidence</strong> suggests a <strong> large difference</strong> among types of news stories in relevance and impact on financial markets. For <strong> example,</strong> we find <strong> unusual returns</strong> in response to <strong> disclosures about</strong> earnings <strong> results,</strong> credit rating, business strategy, the health sector, mergers and acquisitions. Our results <strong> are useful for</strong> managers, investors and <strong> policy-makers. They show</strong> how <strong> to structure</strong> regulatory filings and <strong> which</strong> topics <strong> influence</strong> stock valuations. <strong></strong></div>

They are out</strong> of <strong> the systems of the company</strong> and <strong> are not monitored or controlled.</strong> Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are <strong> delivered and have</strong> processes when suspicions are <strong> raised.</strong> Detecting fraudsters <strong> with computer skills</strong> is a constant game of catch-up. <strong> It's</strong> not only about playing catch-up with the <strong> cyberfraudster,</strong> but also the technologies that can be misused. <strong> Moreover,</strong> the methods <strong> assisting</strong> fraudulent activities <strong> (still out of reach of company systems)</strong> are constantly evolving. This means a <strong> company's</strong> intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or theft. <strong></strong></div>

The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed. First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority.

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Medical practitioners can access</strong> a <strong> wealth of data sources by using</strong> Body Area Networks <strong> (BAN)</strong> to <strong> monitor a patient's real-time vital signs. A BAN refers to a network of wearable or implantable devices worn on or attached to the human body for various purposes. Timely and context-aware delivery of</strong> data is <strong> crucial. This</strong> paper <strong> presents</strong> a system <strong> specifically</strong> designed for patients with cardiac disorders, <strong> focusing</strong> on the design of the sensing device and communication scheme <strong> selected. Many of the current</strong> wearable physiological devices used in <strong> healthcare systems, known as Patient Sensing Devices (PSD),</strong> are bulky and <strong> uncomfortable</strong> for elderly <strong> patients due to their inflexible design. We introduce</strong> a unique <strong> Patient Sensing Device (PSD) that is both flexible and detachable, designed</strong> for <strong> patient comfort. We also propose</strong> a model for <strong> transmitting, storing,</strong> and processing <strong> patient-related data that</strong> ensures <strong> regular</strong> logging of data without <strong> overwhelming</strong> communication networks. <strong> We have</strong> developed and implemented <strong> a proof-of-concept prototype that can transmit a patient's</strong> Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and body <strong> temperature, potentially expanding</strong> to other vital signs. Communication between a mobile <strong> smartphone</strong> and the ECG and temperature acquisition apparatus is <strong> achieved via</strong> Bluetooth. The Data Management System <strong> -</strong> Periodic Model (DMS <strong> -</strong> PM) <strong> introduced here</strong> is <strong> created</strong> to <strong> facilitate the</strong> wireless <strong> connection between</strong> sensor units <strong> and</strong> the patient database at a Medical Service Provider (MSP) through a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or a <strong> smartphone, utilizing</strong> the existing GSM network. <strong></strong></div>

To avoid the time-consuming task</strong> of porting each application to <strong> various platforms due</strong> to <strong> different APIs</strong> and networking protocols, we <strong> developed</strong> the Vassar College Messaging Layer. This layer <strong> simplifies</strong> the Cybiko networking structure and interface, <strong> making it easier to adapt</strong> Cybiko applications to <strong> different platforms without needing</strong> to <strong>make significant changes to the code.</strong></div>

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

Some of the mobile carriers combines context-aware technologies or involve into wireless network environments to make effective use through the combination of learning scenarios and technologies, and then provide students new learning experiences differed from the past learning. In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

A</strong> committee of clinicians <strong> who didn't know about the</strong> participant, intervention group assignment, <strong> or the</strong> baseline or follow-up <strong> data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was</strong> safe or unsafe. <strong> The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The</strong> main outcome <strong> measured</strong> the <strong> difference</strong> in unsafe prescribing <strong> between</strong> the intervention <strong> and</strong> control <strong> groups. At</strong> the <strong> beginning</strong> of the <strong> study, both</strong> groups <strong> had a</strong> similar <strong> proportion of unsafe prescriptions.</strong> (0.27 <strong> vs 0.29) After controlling</strong> for <strong> the</strong> baseline performance, <strong> it was found that those who received the CDSS suite</strong> prescribed <strong> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> more safely than <strong> those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance).

In designing</strong> distributed <strong> systems,</strong> PDAs are <strong> given high importance and</strong> treated as <strong> "first</strong> class <strong> citizens". This means that important assets like electronic money and authentication</strong> keys will be stored in PDAs. <strong> The user should retain ownership</strong> and control of these <strong> assets</strong> and the media that <strong> stores</strong> and <strong> communicates them. This principle</strong> should be <strong> incorporated into</strong> the design of private <strong> systems. We introduced</strong> the <strong> concept of the "open-ended argument"</strong> to describe <strong> our</strong> design <strong> strategy, which focuses on creating systems</strong> that <strong> are intended</strong> to <strong> provide</strong> information to the user <strong> rather than hiding it.</strong> We argue and <strong> demonstrate</strong> that when systems are designed <strong> in</strong> this <strong> manner,</strong> the user (a human) <strong> gains improved</strong> control <strong> over both</strong> the system and <strong> their</strong> personal <strong> data. By enabling users to</strong> make decisions based on qualitative assessment of the <strong> information provided, they are better equipped to make informed choices compared to relying solely on the system's automated decisions.
