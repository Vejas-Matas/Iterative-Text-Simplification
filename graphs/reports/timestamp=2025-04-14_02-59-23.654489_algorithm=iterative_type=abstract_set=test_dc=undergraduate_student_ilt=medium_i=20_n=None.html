For humanoids, a 2D map <strong> isn&amp;#x27;t enough</strong> since they can step over objects and need height information. Considering dynamic obstacles <strong> adds</strong> complexity, <strong> as</strong> they can <strong> cause the robot</strong> to <strong> replan its path and avoid collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create prediction <strong> maps that allow for efficient path planning.</strong> We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

                  <div class="text-muted">Perception of the environment is <strong> necessary</strong> for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments. Most <strong> robots (humanoids</strong> and wheeled <strong> robots)</strong> rely on planar regions. For <strong> humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics),</strong> a 2D map is not sufficient <strong> because</strong> they can step over and onto <strong> objects, so they</strong> need height information. <strong> Dynamic</strong> obstacles <strong> bring</strong> another level of complexity, <strong> because it</strong> can lead to necessary replanning or <strong> collisions.</strong> In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles. Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low <strong> processor</strong> cost. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning. <strong></strong></div>

Web pages are often too large for a PDA screen to present. The same problem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV. Manual reconstruction of web pages for these devices would ease the problem; however, the large variation of display capabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have to customize a web page for each possible display device. <strong> The system breaks down a web page into smaller sections based on the screen size and the page&amp;#x27;s layout and content.</strong> In this paper, we propose a document segmentation and presentation system. The system automatically divides a web document into a number of logical segments based on the screen size and the structure and content of the document.

Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health <strong> goals.</strong> However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation <strong> (IVF)</strong> and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis. <strong> The</strong> necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been <strong> discussed.</strong> The discourse on moral obligations of future <strong> generations</strong> seems to imply that women might be <strong> required</strong> to reproduce with IVF. Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed. These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men. <strong> There are no</strong> unified feminist conclusion about the merits and risks of human genome <strong> modification. There</strong> is <strong> also</strong> an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario. <strong></strong></div>

Manipulations can be as subtle as <strong> changing the</strong> source <strong> code, which is the programming instructions,</strong> or as apparent as adding or removing significant content. To respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, algorithms <strong> are used</strong> to detect phishing websites based on their content, employing a data set consisting of 17,992 phishing attacks targeting 159 different brands. The results of the experiments using different approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate. <strong></strong></div>
