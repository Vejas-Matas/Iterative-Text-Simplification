Deprived of means to keep the owner informed, the positive properties of smartcards are difficult to utilize.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

The paper discusses MiPadu0027s design, implementation work in progress, and preliminary user study in comparison to the existing pen-based PDA interface. MiPad is the application prototype that demonstrates compelling user advantages for wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, MiPad fully integrates continuous speech recognition (CSR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) to enable users to accomplish many common tasks using a multimodal interface and wireless technologies. It tries to solve the problem of pecking with tiny styluses or typing on minuscule keyboards in todayu0027s PDAs. Unlike a cellular phone, MiPad avoids speech-only interaction. It incorporates a built-in microphone that activates whenever a field is selected.

We</strong> build a misinformation detection model that identifies suspicious behavioral patterns and detect misinformation. <strong> We found</strong> 80294 unique tweets and 59660 <strong> users.

                  <div class="text-muted">Motivated by recent financial <strong> crises,</strong> research efforts have been put into studying contagion effects <strong> (spread of market disturbances)</strong> and herding behaviour <strong> (individuals acting collectively without centralized direction)</strong> in financial markets. Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets. We propose a measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic risk <strong> indicator, which signals probability of financial system crises.</strong> We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from Web news sources and analyse the <strong> relation</strong> between financial markets and <strong> financial</strong> news. We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects <strong> variations</strong> in the financial markets. Cohesiveness is <strong> a better</strong> measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms. Our results <strong> show</strong> that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly correlated with <strong> variations in</strong> the financial markets. <strong></strong></div>

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

Then,</strong> the information is <strong> changed</strong> into sound and sent to the user <strong> through</strong> speakers or headphones. In the <strong> first version,</strong> the user <strong> could give</strong> feedback to <strong> change</strong> the system, <strong> but we couldn't add all the</strong> features <strong> due to</strong> technology <strong> limitations.

We conducted</strong> a randomized, controlled trial in a university-based resident clinic. <strong> Residents in internal</strong> medicine <strong> were given a CDSS suite based on PDA. Intervention</strong> residents <strong> were provided with</strong> a CDSS <strong> that had</strong> a prediction rule for <strong> assessing</strong> gastrointestinal risk <strong> related to NSAIDs</strong> and <strong> recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as</strong> standardized patients <strong> (SPs), who were equipped with</strong> musculoskeletal <strong> symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the</strong> study <strong> without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety</strong> outcomes <strong> of</strong> prescriptions given to <strong> standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A</strong> committee of clinicians <strong> who didn't know about the</strong> participant, intervention group assignment, <strong> or the</strong> baseline or follow-up <strong> data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was</strong> safe or unsafe. <strong> The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The</strong> main outcome <strong> measured</strong> the <strong> difference</strong> in unsafe prescribing <strong> between</strong> the intervention <strong> and</strong> control <strong> groups. At</strong> the <strong> beginning</strong> of the <strong> study, both</strong> groups <strong> had a</strong> similar <strong> proportion of unsafe prescriptions.</strong> (0.27 <strong> vs 0.29) After controlling</strong> for <strong> the</strong> baseline performance, <strong> it was found that those who received the CDSS suite</strong> prescribed <strong> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> more safely than <strong> those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to</strong> the CDSS <strong> through a PDA</strong> documented <strong> a</strong> more <strong> comprehensive</strong> assessment of gastrointestinal risk <strong> in patients. Moreover, the presence of the</strong> CDSS <strong> resulted in</strong> fewer unsafe treatment decisions <strong> compared to</strong> participants <strong> who did not have access to</strong> the CDSS. <strong></strong></div>

We particularly study</strong> the <strong> many uncategorized filings. We use</strong> latent Dirichlet allocation <strong> for</strong> topic modeling. This <strong> helps</strong> automatically <strong> predict</strong> the <strong> categories based on the</strong> content of 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. <strong> companies, which announce significant events relevant to shareholders.</strong> We then evaluate the stock market reaction. <strong> Evidence</strong> suggests a <strong> large difference</strong> among types of news stories in relevance and impact on financial markets. For <strong> example,</strong> we find <strong> unusual returns</strong> in response to <strong> disclosures about</strong> earnings <strong> results,</strong> credit rating, business strategy, the health sector, mergers and acquisitions. Our results <strong> are useful for</strong> managers, investors and <strong> policy-makers. They show</strong> how <strong> to structure</strong> regulatory filings and <strong> which</strong> topics <strong> influence</strong> stock valuations. <strong></strong></div>

From a practical <strong> standpoint it would seem that</strong> a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. <strong> Findings suggest that training at volitionally</strong> very slow <strong>durations (&amp;gt;10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.</strong></div>

They are out</strong> of <strong> the systems of the company</strong> and <strong> are not monitored or controlled.</strong> Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are <strong> delivered and have</strong> processes when suspicions are <strong> raised.</strong> Detecting fraudsters <strong> with computer skills</strong> is a constant game of catch-up. <strong> It's</strong> not only about playing catch-up with the <strong> cyberfraudster,</strong> but also the technologies that can be misused. <strong> Moreover,</strong> the methods <strong> assisting</strong> fraudulent activities <strong> (still out of reach of company systems)</strong> are constantly evolving. This means a <strong> company's</strong> intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or theft. <strong></strong></div>

The <strong> goal of</strong> misinformation containment <strong> is to limit</strong> the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching <strong> campaigns to counter misinformation.

First, we provide a <strong> diffusion</strong> model and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority. Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of <strong> Ω(2log1−ϵn4)</strong> in polynomial time unless $NP <strong> \subseteq DTIME(n^{\polylog{n}})$</strong> Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in social networks.

In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS). The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles. <strong></strong></div>

Moreover, some researches indicate that stretch training may induce muscle hypertrophy; however, studies on the topic have been primarily relegated to animal and in vitro models. The purpose of this brief review was to evaluate whether stretch training is a viable strategy to induce muscle hypertrophy in humans. Of the 10 studies identified, 3 observed some significantly positive effects of stretch training on muscle structure. <strong> Intriguingly, in</strong> these studies, <strong> the</strong> stretching was <strong> carried out</strong> with <strong> an apparatus that aided in its performance,</strong> or <strong> with an external overload.</strong> Of the 5 available studies that integrated stretching into a resistance training programme, 2 applied the stretching in the <strong> interset</strong> rest period and were the ones that showed enhanced muscle growth.

This</strong> paper <strong> presents</strong> a system <strong> specifically</strong> designed for patients with cardiac disorders, <strong> focusing</strong> on the design of the sensing device and communication scheme <strong> selected. Many of the current</strong> wearable physiological devices used in <strong> healthcare systems, known as Patient Sensing Devices (PSD),</strong> are bulky and <strong> uncomfortable</strong> for elderly <strong> patients due to their inflexible design. We introduce</strong> a unique <strong> Patient Sensing Device (PSD) that is both flexible and detachable, designed</strong> for <strong> patient comfort. We also propose</strong> a model for <strong> transmitting, storing,</strong> and processing <strong> patient-related data that</strong> ensures <strong> regular</strong> logging of data without <strong> overwhelming</strong> communication networks. <strong> We have</strong> developed and implemented <strong> a proof-of-concept prototype that can transmit a patient's</strong> Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and body <strong> temperature, potentially expanding</strong> to other vital signs. Communication between a mobile <strong> smartphone</strong> and the ECG and temperature acquisition apparatus is <strong> achieved via</strong> Bluetooth. The Data Management System <strong> -</strong> Periodic Model (DMS <strong> -</strong> PM) <strong> introduced here</strong> is <strong> created</strong> to <strong> facilitate the</strong> wireless <strong> connection between</strong> sensor units <strong> and</strong> the patient database at a Medical Service Provider (MSP) through a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or a <strong> smartphone, utilizing</strong> the existing GSM network. <strong></strong></div>

The high-speed evolution, radical price fluctuations of cryptocurrency, and the inconsistent attitudes of monetary authorities in different countries have caused <strong> panic.</strong> In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and <strong> risks</strong> of the cryptocurrency <strong> market.

Moreover, some researches indicate that stretch training may induce muscle <strong> growth.</strong> The purpose of this review was to evaluate <strong> if</strong> stretch training is a viable strategy to induce muscle <strong> growth</strong> in humans. Of the 10 studies identified, 3 observed positive effects of stretch training on <strong> muscles. In</strong> these studies, the stretching was <strong> performed</strong> with <strong> external help like equipment</strong> or <strong> load.</strong> Of the 5 available studies that integrated stretching into <strong> strength training,</strong> 2 applied the stretching in the rest period <strong> between the sets</strong> and were the ones that showed enhanced muscle growth. In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to <strong> produce</strong> beneficial changes in <strong> muscles but</strong> evidence suggests that when stretching is done with a certain <strong> intensity</strong> (particularly when loaded, or added between active muscle <strong> contractions), it</strong> may <strong> induce</strong> muscle <strong>growth.</strong></div>

The purpose of this review was to present the effects of <strong> strength</strong> training on mobility for older adults with muscle function deficits and <strong> to</strong> provide guidelines that can be used with seniors during <strong> strength training.</strong> We <strong> present</strong> evidence that <strong> strength</strong> training can attenuate age-related changes in mobility, including improvements in <strong> walking</strong> speed, static and dynamic balance, and fall risk reduction. Older adults should be encouraged to participate in <strong> strength</strong> training activities, and should <strong>avoid immobility.</strong></div>

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

This is done in computer simulators that mimic real-world traffic.</strong> It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios. <strong> Currently,</strong> the <strong> best methods for generating</strong> driving <strong> scenarios are still done</strong> by <strong> humans.</strong> In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose poorly-engineered or poorly-trained self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

We conducted</strong> a randomized, controlled trial in a university-based resident clinic. <strong> Residents in internal</strong> medicine <strong> were given a CDSS suite based on PDA. Intervention</strong> residents <strong> were provided with</strong> a CDSS <strong> that had</strong> a prediction rule for <strong> assessing</strong> gastrointestinal risk <strong> related to NSAIDs</strong> and <strong> recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as</strong> standardized patients <strong> (SPs), who were equipped with</strong> musculoskeletal <strong> symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the</strong> study <strong> without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety</strong> outcomes <strong> of</strong> prescriptions given to <strong> standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A</strong> committee of clinicians <strong> who didn't know about the</strong> participant, intervention group assignment, <strong> or the</strong> baseline or follow-up <strong> data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was</strong> safe or unsafe. <strong> The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The</strong> main outcome <strong> measured</strong> the <strong> difference</strong> in unsafe prescribing <strong> between</strong> the intervention <strong> and</strong> control <strong> groups. At</strong> the <strong> beginning</strong> of the <strong> study, both</strong> groups <strong> had a</strong> similar <strong> proportion of unsafe prescriptions.</strong> (0.27 <strong> vs 0.29) After controlling</strong> for <strong> the</strong> baseline performance, <strong> it was found that those who received the CDSS suite</strong> prescribed <strong> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> more safely than <strong> those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to</strong> the CDSS <strong> through a PDA</strong> documented <strong> a</strong> more <strong> comprehensive</strong> assessment of gastrointestinal risk <strong> in patients.

                  <div class="text-muted">A Personal Digital Assistant <strong> (PDA) used as a private machine,</strong> is fundamentally <strong> distinct</strong> from traditional <strong> machines because it is a personalized device.</strong> It <strong> offers an unprecedented level of</strong> personal and private <strong> experience,</strong> and its <strong> operation</strong> is <strong> designed to handle</strong> network and power <strong> failures, which are expected to occur frequently. In designing</strong> distributed <strong> systems,</strong> PDAs are <strong> given high importance and</strong> treated as <strong> "first</strong> class <strong> citizens". This means that important assets like electronic money and authentication</strong> keys will be stored in PDAs. <strong> The user should retain ownership</strong> and control of these <strong> assets</strong> and the media that <strong> stores</strong> and <strong> communicates them. This principle</strong> should be <strong> incorporated into</strong> the design of private <strong> systems. We introduced</strong> the <strong> concept of the "open-ended argument"</strong> to describe <strong> our</strong> design <strong> strategy, which focuses on creating systems</strong> that <strong> are intended</strong> to <strong> provide</strong> information to the user <strong> rather than hiding it.</strong> We argue and <strong> demonstrate</strong> that when systems are designed <strong> in</strong> this <strong> manner,</strong> the user (a human) <strong> gains improved</strong> control <strong> over both</strong> the system and <strong> their</strong> personal <strong> data. By enabling users to</strong> make decisions based on qualitative assessment of the <strong> information provided, they are better equipped to make informed choices compared to relying solely on the system's automated decisions.
