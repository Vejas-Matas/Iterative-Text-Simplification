In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning. <strong></strong></div>

In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning. <strong></strong></div>

The results show that transcription rates were higher for the QWERTY keyboard than for the T9, despite the T9 keyboard’s apparent superior physical characteristics. An ancillary experiment demonstrated that the poorer performance of the T9 layout may have resulted from an increase in visual scanning time due to perceptual grouping of the letters on the keys.

We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

This allows</strong> users to <strong> perform</strong> common tasks using a multimodal interface and wireless <strong> technology.</strong> It <strong> aims</strong> to solve the <strong> issue</strong> of <strong> having to use small</strong> styluses or <strong> type</strong> on <strong> tiny</strong> keyboards <strong> on modern</strong> PDAs. <strong> MiPad does not rely solely on speech interaction, unlike</strong> a cellular <strong> phone.</strong> MiPad <strong> has</strong> a built-in microphone that <strong> turns on when</strong> a field is selected. <strong> When</strong> a user taps the screen or <strong> utilizes</strong> a <strong> built-in</strong> roller <strong> for navigation, this</strong> action <strong> reduces</strong> the <strong> range</strong> of <strong> potential</strong> instructions for spoken word <strong> comprehension.</strong> MiPad <strong> is</strong> currently <strong> operating</strong> on a Windows CE Pocket <strong> PC,</strong> with <strong> speech recognition being carried out on</strong> a Windows 2000 <strong> machine. The Windows CE Pocket PC</strong> is <strong> a PDA that runs the Windows Embedded Compact operating system.</strong> The Dr Who CSR engine <strong> combines</strong> a CFG and <strong> an</strong> n-gram language model. The Dr Who SLU engine <strong> uses</strong> a chart parser and a plan-based dialog manager. <strong></strong></div>

The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding data driven ethical dilemmas, such as privacy, fairness and discrimination. The machine may exacerbate, enable, or simply draw attention to the ethical challenges, but it is humans who must be held accountable. Policymakers should seek to devise agreed-upon guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling. Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; criteria for calling out unethical, if not illegal, behavior; categories of privacy and non-privacy harms; and strategies for empowering individuals through access to data in intelligible form. <strong></strong></div>

We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength. <strong></strong></div>

A new cell biological model based on the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei, can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important &#x27;memory&#x27; of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent.

Research is lacking, however, as to the <strong> optimal way to induce</strong> muscle growth. Bodybuilders train with moderate loads and short rest <strong> intervals.</strong> Powerlifters, on the other hand, train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest <strong> periods.</strong> Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for <strong> increasing muscle mass.</strong> It has been shown that many factors mediate the process <strong> of muscle growth</strong> and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in muscle growth.

The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing. Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only initiates the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance. Several researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize training-related muscular adaptations. However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise ‘window’ can vary according to a number of factors.

It also refers to specific physiological processes or states occurring after exercise that are distinct from the physiology of either the exercising or the resting states. In this context, recovery of the cardiovascular system after exercise occurs across a period of minutes to hours, during which many characteristics of the system, even how it is controlled, change over time. Some of these changes may be necessary for long-term adaptation to exercise training, yet some can lead to cardiovascular instability during recovery. Furthermore, some of these changes may provide insight into when the cardiovascular system has recovered from prior training and is physiologically ready for additional training stress. This review focuses on the most consistently observed hemodynamic adjustments and the underlying causes that drive cardiovascular recovery and will highlight how they differ following resistance and aerobic exercise. Primary emphasis will be placed on the hypotensive effect of aerobic and resistance exercise and associated mechanisms that have clinical relevance, but if left unchecked, can progress to symptomatic hypotension and syncope. Finally, we focus on the practical application of this information to strategies to maximize the benefits of cardiovascular recovery, or minimize the vulnerabilities of this state.

In</strong> these studies, the stretching was <strong> performed</strong> with <strong> external help like equipment</strong> or <strong> load.</strong> Of the 5 available studies that integrated stretching into <strong> strength training,</strong> 2 applied the stretching in the rest period <strong> between the sets</strong> and were the ones that showed enhanced muscle growth. In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to <strong> produce</strong> beneficial changes in <strong> muscles but</strong> evidence suggests that when stretching is done with a certain <strong> intensity</strong> (particularly when loaded, or added between active muscle <strong> contractions), it</strong> may <strong> induce</strong> muscle <strong>growth.</strong></div>

It is plausible that cycle training requires a longer period to significantly increase muscle size compared to typical resistance training due to a much slower hypertrophy rate.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Medical practitioners can access</strong> a <strong> wealth of data sources by using</strong> Body Area Networks <strong> (BAN)</strong> to <strong> monitor a patient's real-time vital signs. A BAN refers to a network of wearable or implantable devices worn on or attached to the human body for various purposes. Timely and context-aware delivery of</strong> data is <strong> crucial. This</strong> paper <strong> presents</strong> a system <strong> specifically</strong> designed for patients with cardiac disorders, <strong> focusing</strong> on the design of the sensing device and communication scheme <strong> selected. Many of the current</strong> wearable physiological devices used in <strong> healthcare systems, known as Patient Sensing Devices (PSD),</strong> are bulky and <strong> uncomfortable</strong> for elderly <strong> patients due to their inflexible design. We introduce</strong> a unique <strong> Patient Sensing Device (PSD) that is both flexible and detachable, designed</strong> for <strong> patient comfort. We also propose</strong> a model for <strong> transmitting, storing,</strong> and processing <strong> patient-related data that</strong> ensures <strong> regular</strong> logging of data without <strong> overwhelming</strong> communication networks. <strong> We have</strong> developed and implemented <strong> a proof-of-concept prototype that can transmit a patient's</strong> Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and body <strong> temperature, potentially expanding</strong> to other vital signs. Communication between a mobile <strong> smartphone</strong> and the ECG and temperature acquisition apparatus is <strong> achieved via</strong> Bluetooth.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

In designing</strong> distributed <strong> systems,</strong> PDAs are <strong> given high importance and</strong> treated as <strong> "first</strong> class <strong> citizens". This means that important assets like electronic money and authentication</strong> keys will be stored in PDAs. <strong> The user should retain ownership</strong> and control of these <strong> assets</strong> and the media that <strong> stores</strong> and <strong> communicates them. This principle</strong> should be <strong> incorporated into</strong> the design of private <strong> systems. We introduced</strong> the <strong> concept of the "open-ended argument"</strong> to describe <strong> our</strong> design <strong> strategy, which focuses on creating systems</strong> that <strong> are intended</strong> to <strong> provide</strong> information to the user <strong> rather than hiding it.</strong> We argue and <strong> demonstrate</strong> that when systems are designed <strong> in</strong> this <strong> manner,</strong> the user (a human) <strong> gains improved</strong> control <strong> over both</strong> the system and <strong> their</strong> personal <strong> data. By enabling users to</strong> make decisions based on qualitative assessment of the <strong> information provided, they are better equipped to make informed choices compared to relying solely on the system's automated decisions. We have created a</strong> system <strong> based on the</strong> design guidelines and <strong>we will explain it.</strong></div>

Three aspects are described: selection of depression screening instrument; integration of the instrument into the PDA; and quantitative (usage) and qualitative (focus group) evaluation. Only one third of eligible patients were screened. Twenty percent of those screened were identified as at risk for mood disorder. The barriers to screening identified through focus groups included a lack of time, knowledge, intervention protocol, referral resources, PDA usability issues, preceptor motivation and comfort, as well as perceived or real cultural barriers.

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on 3D maps, and describe technologies required and its use situations. Secondly we compare effectiveness of 2D and 3D maps for navigation by object search experiments under conditions: 3D maps with and without texture; display sizes corresponding to a mobile phone and PDA (Personal Digital Assistant).

              <div class="mb-2"><h6 class="mb-0 small">Prediction</h6>Recently pedestrian navigation has been studied by many researchers, which provides pedestrians with a similar function of car navigation. On the other hand, a 3dimensional (3D) map, which is one of major themes in machine vision research, has been utilized as a simulation tool in city and landscape planning, and other engineering fields. The 3D maps will give more intuitive information compared to conventional 2-dimensional (2D) ones. In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on 3D maps, and describe technologies required and its use situations. Secondly we compare effectiveness of 2D and 3D maps for navigation by object search experiments under conditions: 3D maps with and without texture; display sizes corresponding to a mobile phone and PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). The experimental results show that 3D maps with texture on mobile phone display size, and 3D maps without texture on PDA display size are superior to 2D maps in search time and error rate.

                  <div class="text-muted">A Personal Digital Assistant <strong> (PDA) used as a private machine,</strong> is fundamentally <strong> distinct</strong> from traditional <strong> machines because it is a personalized device.</strong> It <strong> offers an unprecedented level of</strong> personal and private <strong> experience,</strong> and its <strong> operation</strong> is <strong> designed to handle</strong> network and power <strong> failures, which are expected to occur frequently. In designing</strong> distributed <strong> systems,</strong> PDAs are <strong> given high importance and</strong> treated as <strong> "first</strong> class <strong> citizens". This means that important assets like electronic money and authentication</strong> keys will be stored in PDAs. <strong> The user should retain ownership</strong> and control of these <strong> assets</strong> and the media that <strong> stores</strong> and <strong> communicates them. This principle</strong> should be <strong> incorporated into</strong> the design of private <strong> systems. We introduced</strong> the <strong> concept of the "open-ended argument"</strong> to describe <strong> our</strong> design <strong> strategy, which focuses on creating systems</strong> that <strong> are intended</strong> to <strong> provide</strong> information to the user <strong> rather than hiding it.</strong> We argue and <strong> demonstrate</strong> that when systems are designed <strong> in</strong> this <strong> manner,</strong> the user (a human) <strong> gains improved</strong> control <strong> over both</strong> the system and <strong> their</strong> personal <strong> data. By enabling users to</strong> make decisions based on qualitative assessment of the <strong> information provided, they are better equipped to make informed choices compared to relying solely on the system's automated decisions.

                  <div class="text-muted"><strong> Smart</strong> speakers <strong> are becoming popular around</strong> the <strong> world</strong> and people will get used to <strong> this new way of interacting with</strong> the <strong> voice. Even with the progress of</strong> speech <strong> recognition and</strong> natural language processing <strong> (interactions between computers and human language),</strong> users <strong> may</strong> still <strong> get</strong> errors like “cannot <strong> understand” or</strong> “no requested audio <strong> resource”</strong> which can frustrate users. <strong> So,</strong> it is <strong> important</strong> that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper <strong> response during an error message. The responses of</strong> the <strong> most popular brand of</strong> smart <strong> speakers are based</strong> on <strong> 2 elements, apology</strong> and <strong> humor.</strong> We <strong> studied</strong> user’s preference <strong> in</strong> two error <strong> scenarios : “cannot</strong> understand” and “no requested <strong> resource” Satisfaction of the user</strong> and perceived sincerity of <strong> the response</strong> were measured. The results showed that <strong> users</strong> were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speaker apologized in both error scenarios. In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no impact on the satisfaction <strong> or</strong> sincerity. But in the “cannot understand” scenario, <strong> humor</strong> decreased perceived sincerity. <strong></strong></div>

Questions which are posed when designing M-commerce system include: “What kind of information do the users want to access via mobile devices?”, “How can we provide useful applications with limited user input facility?”, “How can we test a distributed M-commerce system?” In this paper, we discuss about some software development issues for mobile commerce systems from our experiences while developing an M-commerce system for tourists. Our prototype, easyHotel, is an useful software that allows booking hotel rooms via mobile phones. <strong></strong></div>

                    <strong>Smartcards lack the capability to communicate with the user in a secure manner, unlike other hardware classes. (Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or "first class citizens". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways.</strong>

                  <div class="text-muted">In the ubiquitous environment, <strong> devices</strong> like personal digital <strong> assistants</strong> or <strong> cell phones</strong> are used to access the <strong> Internet.</strong> We <strong> created</strong> a <strong> system called</strong> ubiquitous/universal passive viewer (u-PaV) that <strong> converts</strong> Web content into <strong> a format suitable for easy</strong> viewing <strong> on</strong> mobile <strong> devices. u-PaV takes text and</strong> images from <strong> the</strong> Web <strong> and creates</strong> a <strong> multimedia file in</strong> Macromedia Flash <strong> format,</strong> a <strong> widely used</strong> multimedia format. <strong> Mobile devices and personal computers have similar</strong> Web <strong> interfaces, although they may look different depending</strong> on the <strong> device. Mobile</strong> and desktop <strong> terminals have</strong> some <strong> differences</strong> in device characteristics, such as screen resolution <strong> and</strong> sound <strong> quality, which can</strong> affect <strong> how content is presented</strong> on the <strong> device. When switching</strong> between interactive and <strong> passive access styles,</strong> the presentation <strong> needs to</strong> be adjusted for the <strong> device</strong> type because <strong> some</strong> information <strong> may be lost during transformation and</strong> not <strong> noticed by</strong> the <strong> user. We developed a visual presentation method to customize how</strong> Web content <strong> is displayed based on</strong> the <strong> device type.</strong> First, we <strong> analyze keywords to capture</strong> the emotional <strong> tone</strong> of a <strong> web</strong> page <strong> and adjust</strong> the <strong> screen's</strong> background color <strong> accordingly. Then, we use</strong> the <strong> keyword's logo to highlight</strong> the <strong> main</strong> subject of the <strong> content. Finally,</strong> we <strong> divide</strong> the <strong> content's image</strong> into <strong> sections</strong> and present <strong> them</strong> one <strong> by one</strong> using visual effects. These <strong> steps</strong> can be <strong> used on</strong> any type of <strong>device.</strong></div>

Therefore, when an error message is reported, it is vital that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper response. However, currently the response strategies adopted by leading smart speaker brands in China differed mainly on two dimensions: “apology or not” and “humor or neutral”. We explored user’s preference of response strategies under two error scenarios——“cannot understand” and “no requested audio resource”. Two dependent variables (satisfaction and perceived sincerity of response) were measured. The results showed that participants were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speaker apologized in both error scenarios. In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no significant impact on the perception of satisfaction and sincerity. But in the “cannot understand” scenario, humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity. <strong></strong></div>
