You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

The most complex part of the passage is the phrase \"minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process.\" This phrase has a slightly higher complexity due to the use of the phrase \"minimal risk (to pedestrians)\".\n\nProposed simplification: \"Permissions were taken from required authorities to ensure a low risk for pedestrians during data collection.\"\n\nInformation loss:\n- Original: \"minimal risk (to pedestrians)\"\n- Simplified: \"low risk for pedestrians\"\nSeverity of information loss: Medium (we lost some specificity, but the general idea remains the same)\n\nILT: Medium-High, Severity of information loss: Medium, so we can accept the change.\n\nThe passage is now: \"Permissions were taken from required authorities to ensure a low risk for pedestrians during data collection.\""
