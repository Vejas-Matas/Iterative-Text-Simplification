You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the original and simplified passages\n"

However, it loses some specific context by not using the term \"unmanned aerial vehicles\" and omitting \"commercial domain.\" \n\nSeverity of information loss:\n1. Definition of \"drone aircraft\": Loss of specificity compared to \"unmanned aerial vehicles\" – Medium severity.\n2. The term \"commercial domain\" is replaced with \"business activities,\" which is a broader term but still relevant – Low severity.\n\nOverall, the severity of information loss is acceptable as it does not exceed the ILT threshold (Medium). Therefore, the change can be accepted."
