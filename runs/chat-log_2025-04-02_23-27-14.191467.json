You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

The most complex parts of the passage are:\n\n- \"39-layered Inception model\" (technical term with no clear definition)\n- \"tomographic reconstructions\" (technical term with no clear definition)\n- \"evaluates the presence of roads\" (requires some domain-specific knowledge)\n\nBased on this analysis, the complexity of the passage is High. Since the determined complexity is higher than DC (Average person), the answer is: Yes"
