[{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a reader assistant. You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The passage:\nIn an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot."}, {"role": "system", "content": "DC: University student\nILT: Medium"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the complexity level of the passage \u2013 provide a level from Low to High and reasons why"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The complexity level of the passage is High. \n\nReasons:\n1. **Technical Vocabulary**: The passage includes specialized terms like \"imitation learning,\" \"data-driven solution,\" and \"UAV autonomy,\" which are not commonly understood without a background in robotics or aviation.\n2. **Complex Sentence Structure**: The sentence is long and contains multiple clauses, which makes it harder to follow.\n3. **Abstract Concepts**: The ideas of imitation learning and autonomy are advanced concepts that require a certain level of understanding in engineering or computer science.\n4. **Lack of Concrete Examples**: The passage does not provide concrete examples or simpler explanations to support the understanding of the technical terms used.\n\nOverall, these factors contribute to a high complexity level appropriate for an expert audience rather than university students."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is determined complexity higher than DC (University student)?
