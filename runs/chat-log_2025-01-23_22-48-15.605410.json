The term \"based on\" indicates a foundational relationship, which could imply a more rigorous connection than \"using.\" This change introduces minor ambiguity (Severity: Low).\n\n2. **No loss of clarity in \"looks for roads using clear images from the input\"**: This section remains clear, and the meaning is retained, ensuring no information loss (Severity: None).\n\n3. **No loss of clarity in \"Using standard ways to organize images\"**: This part effectively communicates the intended method, maintaining clarity (Severity: None).\n\nOverall, the changes made lead to a minor shift in specificity, but the fundamental message of the passage remains intact.
