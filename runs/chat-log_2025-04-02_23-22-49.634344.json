You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

    "content": "The FKGL (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) score of 15.638095238095236 indicates that the passage is written at a high school level, but it's not suitable for an \"Average person\" (DC).\n\nSince the FKGL score is not the only factor that determines complexity, I will analyze the passage to identify the most complex parts. The phrase \"the latest passage version\" suggests that the passage is a revised version, and the term \"FKGL score\" might be unfamiliar to an \"Average person\". The phrase \"FKGL score of the the latest passage version is 15.638095238095236\" is also somewhat complex, as it includes numerical values and metrics.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the determined complexity is higher than DC (Average person).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
