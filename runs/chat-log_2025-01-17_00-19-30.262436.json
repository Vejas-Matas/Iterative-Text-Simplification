You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the original and simplified passages\n"

The simplified version omits this term, potentially losing nuances related to the nature of the signals being monitored.\n\n2. **Integration of components**: The original emphasizes that the system integrates specific components (Wireless ECG transmitter, GPS, and mobile phone) in a conceptual framework, whereas the simplified version states their use more generally. This might lead to a loss in understanding how these components work together systematically.\n\n3. **Technical specificity**: The term \"physiological signals\" in the original is more specific compared to \"health data\" in the simplified version, which may be interpreted more broadly.\n\n**Severity**: The severity of information loss can be considered medium. While the main concepts and functionalities remain intact, key technical details and specificity have been reduced, which could affect the understanding of the system's complexity and design. Therefore, this loss does not exceed the Information Loss Tolerance (ILT)."
