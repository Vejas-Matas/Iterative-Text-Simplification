You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

The original passage is:\n\n\"Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.\"\n\nThis passage is likely to be complex for an average person, so the algorithm will continue to simplify it.\n\nNext, I will identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC. In this case, the entire passage is complex, so the entire passage will be considered.\n\nThe proposed simplification is:\n\"Our system is better at imitation learning than many other models.\"\n\nHowever, this simplification may result in information loss. The severity of the information loss is high because the original passage mentions the Inception-v3 architecture, which is a specific architecture that the model is based on. This information is crucial to understanding how the model works.\n\nThe information loss severity is higher than the ILT (Medium-High), so the changes will be rejected.\n\nThe passage remains the same:\n\"Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.\""
