It allows users to easily do tasks like accessing information, sharing updates, and coordinating teams and vehicles. This paper talks about a new mobile app for managing wildfire information that works on Windows Phone devices. It serves as a useful tool alongside the web version of the AEGIS platform, which helps with wildfire prevention and management. With the AEGIS App, users can navigate routes, search for nearby facilities and firefighting resources, check weather data, and view fire management information like water sources and evacuation sites. A unique feature of the AEGIS App is that it includes a digital assistant called Cortana. This AI assistant, made by Microsoft for Windows Phone, lets users gather information using voice commands. The app is designed for firefighters in Greece and aims to improve the sharing of information between command centers and firefighting teams on the ground."}]
