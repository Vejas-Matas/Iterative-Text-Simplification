You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n"

Here’s the analysis of information loss:\n\n1. **Original passage**: \"unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain\"\n   - **Updated passage**: \"unmanned aerial vehicles being used in civilian and commercial activities\"\n   - **Information Loss**: The phrase \"getting involved in\" is less definitive than \"being used in,\" which could imply a more direct action. The term \"domain\" is replaced with \"activities,\" which slightly changes the meaning by shifting from a broad context to specific usages.\n\n**Severity of Information Loss**: Low. The essential meaning remains intact, focusing on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in civilian and commercial settings.
