Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

    "content": "A significative percentage of the human population suffer from impairments in their capacity to distinguish or even see colours. For them, everyday tasks like navigating through a train or metro network map becomes demanding. We present a novel technique for extracting colour information from everyday natural stimuli and presenting it to visually impaired users as pleasant, non-invasive sound. This technique was implemented in a portable device. The device extracts colour information from images and converts it to sound for the user. Some features were not included yet because the technology is not advanced enough. We are confident that the full implementation will be possible in the near future as PDA technology improves."

The severity of this loss is Low, as it is a trivial change that does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The loss is also that the original phrase \"was not advanced enough\" implies a past tense, whereas the simplified version implies a present tense. The severity of this loss is Very Low, as the original and simplified versions convey the same idea. Overall, the information loss is minimal."
