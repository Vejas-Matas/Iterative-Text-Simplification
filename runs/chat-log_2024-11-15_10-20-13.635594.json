Four kinds of monitor units were specially designed for a wireless communication, including a control center , a local monitor unit, mobile devices (personal digital assistant; PDA), and a Web page (for both patient and doctor). The use of various monitor units is created to fulfill different medical personnel requirements and wishes. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient."}, {"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide the final version of the simplified passage"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This paper presents a wireless patient monitoring system.
