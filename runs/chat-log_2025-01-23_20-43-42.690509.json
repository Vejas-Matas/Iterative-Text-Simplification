[{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a reader assistant. You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The passage:\nWith the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too."}, {"role": "system", "content": "DC: University student\nILT: Medium"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the complexity level of the passage \u2013 provide a level from Low to High and reasons why"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The complexity level of the passage is **Medium**. \n\nReasons for this assessment include:\n1. **Vocabulary**: The passage contains multiple specialized terms like \"unmanned aerial vehicles,\" \"autonomy,\" and \"civilian and commercial domain,\" which may not be familiar to all readers, particularly those who are not well-versed in the field of aviation or technology.\n2. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is relatively long and incorporates multiple concepts, making it more difficult to follow.
