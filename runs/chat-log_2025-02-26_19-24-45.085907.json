Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"
