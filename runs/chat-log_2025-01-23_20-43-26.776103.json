[{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a reader assistant. You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The passage:\nIn the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research."}, {"role": "system", "content": "DC: University student\nILT: Medium"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the complexity level of the passage \u2013 provide a level from Low to High and reasons why"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The complexity level of the passage can be rated as Medium. \n\nReasons:\n1. **Vocabulary**: The passage uses terms like \"autonomous vehicles,\" \"academic,\" and \"industrial research\" which may not be familiar to all readers, particularly those without a background in technology or academia.\n2. **Concepts**: The idea of \"automation and robotics\" involves a certain level of technical understanding that may require prior knowledge or context.\n3. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is relatively straightforward and does not contain complex grammatical constructions, but the concepts introduced raise the complexity.\n\nOverall, while the sentence is clear, the specialized terminology and concepts lend to a Medium complexity level."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is determined complexity higher than DC (University student)?
