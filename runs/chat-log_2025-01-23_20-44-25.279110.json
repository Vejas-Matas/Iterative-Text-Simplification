You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n"

The use of clauses adds to the complexity.\n3. **Layered Description**: The concept of a \"39-layered model\" adds nuances that may require background knowledge in deep learning and neural networks.\n4. **Abstract Concepts**: The idea of evaluating the presence of roads using tomographic reconstructions is abstract and may not be immediately clear to someone without familiarity with the associated technologies.\n\nOverall, these factors contribute to a higher level of complexity, making the passage challenging for a general audience or undergraduates not specialized in this area."
