You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the original and simplified passages\n"

This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field."

The updated passage just states it is \"used alongside,\" which is less precise in highlighting its complementary nature.\n   - **Severity:** Medium\n\n3. **Omission of details about the role of the app in wildfire prevention:** The original text states the app helps with both \"wildfire prevention and management.\" The updated version simply states it helps with managing wildfire information, potentially diminishing the understanding of its dual purpose.\n   - **Severity:** Medium\n\n4. **Reduction in complexity of technical terms:** The original passage uses \"wildfire information management\" and related technical concepts. The updated passage simplifies this without fully explaining how the app contributes to management.\n   - **Severity:** Low\n\nOverall, the total severity of information loss can be considered medium, as the key aspects of the app's innovation and its relationship to the AEGIS platform have been slightly weakened, but the overall functionality remains clear."
