There are four types of monitor units designed for wireless communication: a control center, a local monitor, mobile devices (like PDAs), and a web page for both patients and doctors. These different monitor units are made to meet the needs of various medical staff. This system aims to give patients and medical workers more freedom and flexibility, which will help improve health care quality and patients' lifestyles."}]
