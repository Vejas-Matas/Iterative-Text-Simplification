You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

The complexity arises from the use of technical jargon like \"computational efficiency\" and the scientific unit \"m/sec\". The complexity level of the passage is around 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is the simplest and 10 is the most complex.

The severity of the loss is moderate, as the original phrase provided more specific information about the drone's speed. The term \"meters per second\" was preserved, but the original passage used \"m/sec\" which is a more concise scientific unit. The loss of the word \"computational efficiency\" might be considered high, as it's an important concept in the original passage.
