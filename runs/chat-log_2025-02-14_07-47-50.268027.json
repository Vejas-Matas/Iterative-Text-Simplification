You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

    "content": "To identify complex parts of the text, I'll analyze the sentence structure and vocabulary. The identified complex part is: \"the automation of society is next\" as it is a metaphorical expression and requires a certain level of understanding. This part has a complexity level of 4 (on a scale of 1-5). The overall complexity of the passage is 2 (on a scale of 1-5), as it is a simple declarative sentence with basic vocabulary. The passage is at a relatively low complexity level, but the identified complex part is a potential area for simplification."
