[{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a reader assistant. You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The passage:\nIn the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research."}, {"role": "system", "content": "DC: University student\nILT: Medium"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify which parts of the text are the most complex, then the complexity level of the passage"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To identify the most complex parts of the passage, I'll analyze the text and categorize the phrases based on their complexity. \n\nThe passage: \"In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.\"\n\n1. \"In the modern era of automation and robotics\" - This phrase is a complex noun phrase with two abstract concepts (automation and robotics) and a time period (era).\n2. \"autonomous vehicles\" - This phrase has two words that are moderately complex, but not overly so.\n3. \"currently the focus of academic and industrial research\" - This phrase is somewhat complex due to the use of the preposition \"of\" and the abstract concept of research.\n\nComplexity level of the passage: 6/10\n\nThe passage is moderately complex, with some abstract concepts and a few complex phrases.
