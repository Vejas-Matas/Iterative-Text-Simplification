Four kinds of monitor units were specially designed for a wireless communication, including a control center , a local monitor unit, mobile devices (personal digital assistant; PDA), and a Web page (for both patient and doctor). The use of various monitor units is created to fulfill different medical personnel requirements and wishes. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient."

There are four types of monitoring units designed for wireless communication: a control center, a local monitor unit, mobile devices (like a personal digital assistant), and a website for both patients and doctors. These different units are made to meet the various needs of medical staff. This system aims to give more freedom and flexibility to both patients and medical staff, ultimately improving healthcare quality and the patients' quality of life."
