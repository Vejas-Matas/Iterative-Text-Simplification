Some of the mobile carriers combines context-aware technologies or involve into wireless network environments to make effective use through the combination of learning scenarios and technologies, and then provide students new learning experiences differed from the past learning. In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning."}, {"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide the final version of the simplified passage"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In recent years, mobile technologies have been developed and used in education.

These mobile devices often use context-aware technologies, which adapt to the user's environment, and connect to wireless networks to enhance learning experiences that differ from traditional methods. Previous studies have shown that mobile learning, which is learning facilitated by mobile devices, can significantly improve interaction between students and their learning environments, helping them achieve their educational goals.\n\nIn the realm of mobile learning, it has become increasingly important to use mobile devices and appropriate learning methods or strategies to enhance the learning experience for different students. This study aims to examine the learning achievements and attitudes of elementary school students who participated in a campus plant learning activity using mobile devices and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results indicate that the group of students using competitive learning strategies performed better academically than those who did not use these strategies. After completing the learning activity, both groups of students showed a positive attitude toward their learning experiences."}]
