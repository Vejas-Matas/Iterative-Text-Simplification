You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the original and simplified passages\n"

For them, everyday tasks like navigating through a train or metro network map becomes demanding. We present a novel technique for extracting colour information from everyday natural stimuli and presenting it to visually impaired users as pleasant, non-invasive sound. This technique was implemented inside a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) portable device. In this implementation, colour information is extracted from the input image and categorised according to how human observers segment the colour space. This information is subsequently converted into sound and sent to the user via speakers or headphones. In the original implementation, it is possible for the user to send its feedback to reconfigure the system, however several features such as these were not implemented because the current technology is limited.We are confident that the full implementation will be possible in the near future as PDA technology improves."
