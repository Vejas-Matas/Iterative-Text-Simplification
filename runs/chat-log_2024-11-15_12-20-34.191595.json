You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the original and simplified passages\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The passage:\nSecond, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car passengers\u2019 features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict age and gender of passengers."}, {"role": "system", "content": "DC: University student\nILT: Medium"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the complexity level of the passage"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The complexity level of the passage is above that of a university student.
