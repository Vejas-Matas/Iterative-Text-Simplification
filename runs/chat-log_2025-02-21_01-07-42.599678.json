You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) \u2013 a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) \u2013 a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

    "content": "To determine if the text is at the desired complexity (DC: Average person), we need to assess its clarity and simplicity. The current text is somewhat technical and might be difficult for an average person to understand.\n\nThe current complexity of the text is high because it uses technical terms like \"MAVNet\" and \"6m/sec\", which might be unfamiliar to non-experts. \n\nTo simplify the text, we can propose a change: \"The MAVNet drone can fly fast.\" \n\nThis simplification removes technical terms and makes the text more accessible to an average person. However, we need to assess the information loss and its severity.\n\nInformation loss: \n- MAVNet is a specific type of drone system (lost information: a key detail about the drone)\n- 6m/sec is the speed of the drone (lost information: a specific detail about the drone's capability)\n\nSeverity of information loss: High\n\nSince the severity of information loss is higher than the ILT (Medium-High), we will reject this change. \n\nThe passage remains: \"The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.\""
