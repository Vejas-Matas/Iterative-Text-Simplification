Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the final simplified passage\n\nWhen responding to prompts, only respond to the given question and do not proceed to the next step\n"

    "content": "To simplify the passage, we need to identify a section that is above the desired complexity (DC: Average person). The given passage is already quite simple, so we will identify a section that can be made even more understandable.\n\nThe identified section is: \"fast 39-layered Inception model\". This section may be a bit complex for an average person, so we will propose a simplification.\n\nProposed simplification: \"fast Inception model\" (removed \"39-layered\")\n\nNow, we need to identify the information loss and its severity. The original passage mentioned that the model is \"39-layered\", which might be an important detail for someone familiar with Inception models. However, for an average person, the exact number might not be crucial. The severity of the information loss is Medium-High, which is within our ILT threshold (Medium-High). Therefore, we can accept the change.\n\nThe updated passage: \"Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.\""
