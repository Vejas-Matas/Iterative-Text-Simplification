People can easily do many everyday tasks like getting information, sharing ideas, and organizing staff and vehicles. This paper introduces a new mobile app for managing wildfire information that works on Windows Phone. It complements the online AEGIS platform for preventing and managing wildfires. With the AEGIS App, users can find routes, look up nearby facilities and firefighting support, check weather data, and see fire management information like water sources and evacuation sites. A cool feature of the AEGIS App is that it uses a digital assistant called Cortana, which understands voice commands, to help with these tasks. The app is designed for firefighters in Greece and aims to improve how information and knowledge are shared between firefighting centers and teams in the field."}]
