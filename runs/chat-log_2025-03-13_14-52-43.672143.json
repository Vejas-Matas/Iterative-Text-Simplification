Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5.

In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning."

    "content": "Since the FKGL score of the passage is 18.05802391441158, which is higher than the desired complexity (DC: Average person), we need to simplify it. \n\nIdentify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC: \nThe passage as a whole has a high FKGL score, so we will consider the paragraph as a whole. \n\nPropose a simplification of the identified section: \nWe can simplify the passage by removing some of the complex sentences and using simpler vocabulary. \n\nExample of simplification: \nOriginal: \"In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning.\"\nSimplified: \"Previous studies have shown that mobile learning can improve student learning and help them interact with their surroundings.\"\n\nIdentify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT: Medium-High), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage: \nThe original and simplified sentences have a similar meaning, so the information loss is low. The severity of information loss is low, which is within the ILT threshold, so we can update the passage.\n\nAdjusted passage: \nIn recent years, mobile technologies have developed and applied in education fields, and some mobile emerging carriers with mobile technologies include a personal digital assistant (PDA), smart phone, and e-book.
