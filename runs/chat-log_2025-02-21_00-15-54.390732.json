Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3.

Identify information loss and the severity of it \u2013 if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5.

    "content": "To start the simplification process, we first need to determine if the current complexity of the passage is at the desired complexity (DC) of \"Average person\". Since the current passage is quite short and simple, let's analyze its complexity.\n\nThe passage has 2 sentences with a total of 15 words, which is relatively simple. However, the vocabulary and sentence structure are still a bit complex for an average person. The desired complexity for an \"Average person\" is not a well-defined metric, but for the sake of this exercise, let's assume it's around 50-100 words per passage.\n\nSince the current passage is longer than 100 words, we will continue with the algorithm.\n\nThe current complexity of the passage is above the desired complexity of an \"Average person\". We will identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC and propose a simplification.\n\nThe identified section is: \"an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.\"\n\nThis section has a high level of technical jargon and complex sentence structure, which makes it difficult for an average person to understand. We will propose a simplification of this section.\n\nProposed simplification: \"We propose a way to teach drones to navigate through city streets by learning from expert pilots.\"\n\nInformation loss: The proposed simplification loses some of the original meaning, as the phrase \"imitation learning based, data-driven solution\" is not explicitly mentioned. However, the overall idea of teaching drones to navigate through city streets by learning from expert pilots is still conveyed.\n\nThe severity of the information loss is Medium, which is below the ILT of Medium-High. We will update the current state of the passage.\n\nThe updated passage: \n\"In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose a way to teach drones to navigate through city streets by learning from expert pilots.\"\n\nPlease proceed to the next step."
