Four kinds of monitor units were specially designed for a wireless communication, including a control center , a local monitor unit, mobile devices (personal digital assistant; PDA), and a Web page (for both patient and doctor). The use of various monitor units is created to fulfill different medical personnel requirements and wishes. This application was developed to promote the mobility and flexibility for the patients and also for the medical personnel, which further will improve both the quality of health care and lifestyle of the patient."}, {"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide the final version of the simplified passage"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This paper presents a wireless system for monitoring patients' electrical activity of the heart (electrophysiological monitoring). The system includes a device that transmits heart signals (Wireless ECG signal transmitter), a Global Positioning System (GPS) device to track location, and a mobile phone to collect health signals. These signals are sent to a local server using Bluetooth, a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate over short distances. \n\nFour types of monitoring units have been specifically designed for this wireless communication system: a control center that manages information, a local monitor unit for real-time data, mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA) for on-the-go access, and a web page for both patients and doctors to view information. These various monitoring units are created to meet the different needs of medical staff and patients. \n\nThe aim of this application is to enhance the movement and flexibility of both patients and medical personnel, ultimately improving the quality of healthcare and the patient's lifestyle."}]
