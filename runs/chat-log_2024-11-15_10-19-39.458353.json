These technologies often use context-aware features and wireless networks to create effective learning experiences for students that are different from traditional methods. Studies have shown that mobile learning can enhance how students interact with their surroundings and achieve learning goals. A key focus in mobile learning is finding the right methods and strategies for different students to improve their learning. This study aims to explore how mobile technology and competitive learning strategies affect the learning achievements and attitudes of elementary school students during a plant learning activity. The results indicate that students who engaged in competitive learning performed better than those who did not. Both groups showed a strong positive attitude toward learning after the activity."}]
