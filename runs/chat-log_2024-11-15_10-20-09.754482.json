Some of the mobile carriers combines context-aware technologies or involve into wireless network environments to make effective use through the combination of learning scenarios and technologies, and then provide students new learning experiences differed from the past learning. In view of the application of mobile technology in education, some previous studies have addressed that mobile learning is a meaningful learning that can improve the interaction between students and the situations and reach the purposes of learning. In the main stream of mobile learning, using mobile carriers with suitable learning methods or strategies in mobile learning activities for different students to enhance learning have gradually become a important and concern issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the learning achievement and learning attitude of elementary school students on a campus plant learning activity when they use mobile carriers and competitive learning strategies. The experimental results show that the competitive learning group of students have better learning performance than non-competitive learning group of students. After completing the learning activity, the two groups of students presented high positive attitudes towards learning."}, {"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide the final version of the simplified passage"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In recent years, mobile technologies have grown and are now used in education. Some mobile tools include personal digital assistants (PDAs), smartphones, and e-books. These tools often use context-aware technology and work with wireless networks. This helps create new learning experiences for students. \n\nResearch has shown that mobile learning is effective. It enhances the interaction between students and their learning environments, helping them achieve their learning goals. A key focus in mobile learning is to use the right methods and strategies to support different students.\n\nThis study looks at how mobile tools and competitive learning strategies affect elementary school students during a plant learning activity. Results show that students in the competitive learning group performed better than those in the non-competitive group. After the activity, both groups had positive attitudes toward learning."}]
