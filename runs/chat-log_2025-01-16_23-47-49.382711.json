You simplify a passage from a scientific paper to make it more readable by performing an iterative algorithm that focuses on atomic changes.\n\nYou are also given two parameters: DC (Desired Complexity) – a desired complexity of the simplified text, and ILT (Information Loss Tolerance) – a threshold for information loss compared to original passage that specifies whether an atomic change should be accepted or not.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Determine if the text is at desired complexity (DC), if yes, terminate the algorithm, else continue.\n2. Identify a section of the text whose complexity is above DC.\n3. Propose a simplification of the identified section.\n4. Identify information loss and the severity of it – if the severity for any of the information loss questions is higher than information loss tolerance (ILT), reject changes, else update the current state of the passage\n5. Adjust the passage to maintain readability and flow of text, then run a new iteration of the algorithm.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, you print the original and simplified passages\n"

The original implies a focus on autonomy, while the simplified version conveys a more general idea.\n\n2. **Loss of Technical Detail**: The phrase \"imitation learning based\" is simplified to \"uses imitation learning,\" which removes the direct connection to the approach being a foundational element.\n   - **Severity**: Medium. It may impact the understanding of how the methodology forms the basis of the solution.\n\n3. **Reduction of Context**: The phrase \"navigating through city streets\" is kept, maintaining the context but without the original emphasis on the complexity of \"autonomy.\"\n   - **Severity**: Low. Context is preserved but slightly less emphasized.\n\nOverall, there is a medium severity level of information loss as the original passage presented a more technical and specific approach to UAV autonomy, while the simplified version leads to a loss in precision and detail. Since the information loss severity is medium and within the allowed tolerance (ILT), the changes can be accepted."
